You will go under a fairly new two lane bridge in Eagle Rock, then float through some riffles before following the main channel to river right around an island.&nbsp; After you float over this little gravel bar look for a campsite.&nbsp; There aren’t good campsites immediately upstream of Eagle Rock.</span></p>
<p><span class=""blog"" style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Eagle Rock to Buchanan:</strong> From Eagle Rock to Buchanan is about 20 miles.&nbsp; Mountains surround the river for the first few miles.&nbsp; There are several islands and many riffly gravel bars.&nbsp; When you go under a railroad bridge that emerges from a tunnel in the right bank, you’ll know that you’re entering Horseshoe bend, which has pretty rapids, a hill on the inside of the bend, and floodplain fields on the outside of the bend.&nbsp; Once you go under the second railroad bridge you’re through the bend and headed toward Springwood.&nbsp; The rocky mountain in front of you, which has only a thin row of trees along the ridge, is Purgatory Mountain.&nbsp; It is visible even before you enter Horseshoe Bend.&nbsp; There is a long straight stretch of river from which you can see the I81 bridge in the distance. &nbsp;There is good fishing here in the woody cover along the shore.&nbsp; This four mile or so stretch of flatwater is very slow.&nbsp; After going under the I81 bridge, the river curves northeast, first passing forest, then a public field in the town of Buchanan.&nbsp; There is a good campsite on river left across from the field, in view of the town.&nbsp; Or you can continue under the Route 11 bridge and choose from among several spots in the next couple of miles.&nbsp; Buchanan has a good restaurant on Main Street.&nbsp; The gas station has basic provisions like cheese, beer, and bread.&nbsp; If you’ve lost your hat you might be able to find one at the antiques store.&nbsp; Note the suspension foot bridge next to Route 11.</span></p>
<p><span class=""blog"" style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Buchanan to Glasgow:</strong> Tie in your gear, as there is a sizable wave train immediately downstream of Buchanan, where the river skirts a high bluff on the right and narrows down.&nbsp; Then the land widens and flattens out for a while.&nbsp; Here you can catch a bunch of sunfish and some bass along the big rocks at the edge of the river.&nbsp; There are many good picnic spots on rocks and sandy banks along these turns.&nbsp; In just a few miles you’ll go under the Arcadia Road bridge, a fairly ugly new concrete span.&nbsp; A few miles downstream of Arcadia is a beautiful campsite, where the river falls over a couple of foot high ledges with an island in the middle.&nbsp; The campsite is on river left just downstream of those ledges.&nbsp; Look for a nice spot on the sandy bank if you’re going to camp here.&nbsp; You’ll reach here midday.&nbsp; If you camp here you will reach Snowden on day 4 with no problem, but won’t have too much time to hang around Balcony Falls.&nbsp; If you want to spend more time at Balcony, continue downstream.&nbsp; As the massive Blue Ridge comes into full view, you go under a road bridge at Glasgow, then soon come to a large, pebbly, forested island on the left.&nbsp; Land on the bank after going through the rapids formed by the gravel bar.&nbsp; This is a great campsite.</span></p>
<p><span class=""blog"" style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Glasgow to Snowden:</strong> Start as early as possible so you can see the mist lifting from the gorge where the James cuts through the Blue Ridge.&nbsp; Not far downstream from the campsite you’ll see the Maury River enter on the left.&nbsp; You’ll know it is the Maury because you’ll see a rail bridge crossing the Maury not far upstream of the confluence, and because the confluence is quite rocky.&nbsp; After the Maury enters, you’ll enter the gorge, and it is all rapids until you reach the dam slackwater near Snowden.&nbsp; Make sure you tie your gear down.&nbsp; If you don’t put floatation in your boat and capsize you may well lose you boat on a rock.&nbsp; The river can get real shallow in this stretch as it spreads out over a rocky bottom.&nbsp; Balcony Falls is on river left as the river goes around a big curve.&nbsp; The railroad on the left is supported by a stone block wall right next to Balcony.&nbsp; Pull up to the right of Balcony on the giant boulder to scout.&nbsp; At low water levels Balcony is runnable for somewhat experienced canoeists in a canoe loaded with camping gear.&nbsp; At high levels, where large and irregular waves make swamping probable, look for an easy route to the right of the big scouting boulder.&nbsp; There is a single narrow drop that is sudden but clear and easy when Balcony is too high to run with camping gear.&nbsp; It is also possible to portage over the big boulder.&nbsp; Once you’re through Balcony eddy out to river right of the rapid and swim through the rapid or take the inner tube out of your boat and float through on that.&nbsp; This gorge, both above and below Balcony, is great fishing.&nbsp; Cast into the eddies.&nbsp; After going through Balcony there is another mile or so of rapids, then the river flattens out from the dam.&nbsp; Take out is on river left.&nbsp; The official take out is just downstream of the Appalachian Trail bridge over the James.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don’t enjoy paddling slackwater you can also take out about a half mile upstream and drag your boat over the railroad tracks. </span></p>",,1,1,0,1,"2011-03-12 18:58:14",62,,"2012-01-07 17:53:21",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 18:58:14","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The James from Snowden to Lynchburg is littered with a series of 7 dams installed by Dominion Virginia Power.&nbsp; Thus it is not possible to comfortably run the James from source to sea. (Though people have done it - the portages on these Dams are esspecially painful)&nbsp; The furthest upriver put in below Balcony Falls is in Lynchburg.&nbsp; From Lynchburg to Watkins Landing, the landing closest to Richmond that doesn’t necessitate paddling the 10 mile slackwater above Bosher Dam, is about 135 miles.&nbsp; There are no rapids harder than class 2.&nbsp; From Bent Creek to New Canton/Bremo Bluff (where Rt 15 crosses the river) there are many forested and rocky bluffs around the river, as well as frequent riffles and rocky islands.&nbsp; From Rt 15 to Watkins Landing, which is located off Route 60 (not at a bridge; the nearest bridge is 522—Maidens landing) the river is significantly slower and flatter, with few dramatic hills around it.&nbsp; There are great campsites all along this stretch, often located on islands or the inside of bends.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">There are a number of great trips in this stretch, ranging from a 10 day or so run from Lynchburg to Watkins Landing to day trips on almost any stretch.&nbsp; Reckon on floating about 10 to 12 miles without much effort, perhaps closer to 15 if you get an early start and like to paddle.&nbsp; The current is much slower here, which is why you go half to 2/3 as far in a day compared to traveling the James in the Valley.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Lynchburg to Bent Creek:</strong> This 28 mile stretch of river has good scenery and fishing, and quite a few good campsites.&nbsp; It is the least traveled part of the James, due to the lack of public put ins.&nbsp; Canoeists will have very little company after leaving Lynchburg.&nbsp; Campers arriving in Lynchburg in the evening can camp on an island just upstream of the Amherst Hwy/Rt 163 bridge, immediately downstream of the Scotts Mill dam.&nbsp; The James is quite pretty in Lynchburg, with forested banks and a view of the old brick buildings in downtown Lynchburg.&nbsp; The river flows around Percival Island, on which the Blackwater Creek rail trail is located.&nbsp; A couple miles after leaving the city the river passes under the Route 29 Bypass, a four lane span.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, amongst many pretty rocks and tiny islands, the Kelly landing is visible on the right.&nbsp; The water moves pretty quickly from Lynchburg to Kelly.&nbsp; The small ledges continue on toward Joshua Falls, located about 5 miles or so below Kelly.&nbsp; The falls are the remains of an old dam, so currents are a bit unusual and boaters should proceed with caution.&nbsp; The clear route is center right, but be sure to avoid going too far right, where the remains of the dam create some possible pinning rocks. &nbsp;There are camping possibilities immediately downstream of Joshua Falls.&nbsp; The next major landmark below Joshua Falls is Chase Island, a quarter to half mile long forested island in the middle of the river.&nbsp; Four miles or so below Chase Island is Pettyjohn Island, over a mile long and pastured in the middle, with access via a ford.&nbsp; Pettyjohn is not good for camping because it is heavily used.&nbsp; Instead, proceed downstream about two miles and look for a sandy spot on the left bank, in the vicinity of Walkers Ford, right as Christian Island comes into view.&nbsp; Christian Island would be a good place to camp except that a nearby industrial facility makes the river very noisy around it, so camping is not recommended until about halfway down Wreck Island, located immediately downstream of Christian Island.&nbsp; Wreck Island has the most significant rapid of this stretch of river, a 100 yard long gravel bar that is easy except for a few potential pinning rocks.&nbsp; In 1987 a bateau pinned on one of these rocks and was split in half.&nbsp; After Wreck Island the river is very flat and slow, except for an abrupt class 1+ rapid until it reaches the Smith Islands, a nice series of forested islands located just over a mile upstream of Bent Creek.&nbsp; When arriving at Bent Creek, note the old bridge piers, which were constructed by the James River and Kanawha Canal Company.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Bent Creek to Wingina: Bent Creek (Rt 60 bridge crossing) to Wingina (Rt 56 bridge crossing) is a lovely 15 mile or so run.&nbsp; This is about a daylong float.&nbsp; The general store at Bent Creek is well stocked.&nbsp; The new James River State Park protects much of the bank on the right side for the first few miles of the trip, and offers attractive camping about 2 to 3 miles downstream of Bent Creek.&nbsp; It is possible to put in at James River State Park rather than Bent Creek, although this will cost a few dollars.&nbsp; A few miles after James River State Park the Tye River enters from the left.&nbsp; It is by far the largest tributary to enter the James on this stretch.&nbsp; When the Tye comes in you’re about 2/3 of the way from Bent Creek to Wingina, and almost to Cunningham Island.&nbsp; Also known as Helena Island, Cunningham Island is a Nature Conservancy preserve.&nbsp; There are good campsites at the head of the island next to the river’s left channel, where there are great sand deposits from high water.&nbsp; It is also possible to camp on the island under the forest canopy, although in summer the grasses grow about 5 foot high and there can be thick mosquitoes.&nbsp; Cunningham is a georgeous island.&nbsp; The mature hardwood forest and arching vines create the feeling of being in a cavernous cathedral.&nbsp; Subtle parallel ridges, created by high water, curve over the island on a parallel axis to the river.&nbsp; The island’s bank is about 10 foot high.&nbsp; I recommend floating down along the island on an inner tube and walking back through the island’s interior, particularly in spring before the mosquitoes get bad or the grasses grow too high.&nbsp; There is hardly any poison ivy, and the combination of ground cover and high canopy is breathtaking.&nbsp; Wingina is just a couple miles below Cunningham Island.&nbsp; The only negative aspect of this trip is a white trailer on a deforested bluff on the Buckingham County side not too far from Cunningham Island.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Wingina to Howardsville:</strong> This stretch is about the same length as from Bent Creek to Wingina.&nbsp; The best weekend float trip on the James in the Piedmont is probably from Bent Creek to Howardsville.&nbsp; Shortly after leaving Wingina you’ll pass midsize Swift Island.&nbsp; About 3/5 of the way through this trip you’ll pass Buford Island, a large, beautiful island square in the middle of the river.&nbsp; Only a couple miles after Buford you’ll reach Dog Island, which is also quite pretty, though covered with No Trespassing signs.&nbsp; There are a few camping opportunities on small islands after Dog Island, but it is preferable to camp on the sandy areas at the head of Buford or Dog Island, where sand has collected in the lee of rocks and trees during high water.&nbsp; These areas are not posted at Dog Island.&nbsp; There is plenty of other camping on this stretch as well.&nbsp; The scenery is wonderful, classic Piedmont, silver maples and sycamores lining the banks, beautiful agricultural lands on the Nelson County side, with little to no intrusion by development.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Howardsville to Warren:</strong> This is only a few miles, takes just 2 or 3 hours.&nbsp; The first part is flat and wide with no camping opportunities.&nbsp; Not too far above Warren there are a bunch of little islands with great camping opportunities.&nbsp; This part above Warren is one of the prettiest stretches.&nbsp; Note that Warren is only accessible from the Albemarle County side.&nbsp; There is no bridge, and the landing on the Buckingham side may be private.&nbsp; Note that any trips in this area can be shuttled using a bicycle.&nbsp; The roads in Albemarle/Nelson along the river are paved, fairly level, extraordinarily beautiful, and have very little traffic.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Warren to Scottsville:</strong> This is a beautiful stretch, with dramatic Rock Island just ¾ miles into the trip, but is also the most crowded stretch of the James because James River Runners dumps hundreds of drunken tubers into the water at Warren and recovers them at Hatton.&nbsp; Hatton Ferry, privately owned by James River Runners, is about 3 miles downstream of Warren.&nbsp; You can use it for a fee.&nbsp; Scottsville is another 6 miles downstream of Hatton, so the distance from Warren to Scottsville is 9 miles.&nbsp; The first mile or so is the prettiest.&nbsp; From Hatton to Scottsville is flat, wide, and slow.&nbsp; Scottsville has all kinds of food and fishing equipment for sale.&nbsp; A nice overnighter is Warren to New Canton.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Scottsville to New Canton/Bremo:</strong> This is about a 12 mile stretch, the first half of which his flat and slow, the second half of which is riffly, laced with islands, and absolutely beautiful.&nbsp; Many of those islands are part of the Seven Islands group, including Big Island.&nbsp; About in the middle of the islands is a boat launch on the north bank, at the James River Wildlife Management Area.&nbsp; This section of river has good fishing and plenty of camping spots.&nbsp; It is very easy for a group to get separated and lost in the island area, so be sure to stay together.&nbsp; There is a short flat stretch between the end of the islands and the Rt 15 bridge.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>New Canton to Columbia:</strong> This is a generally flat 12 mile stretch.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Columbia to Cartersville:</strong> I reckon this is about 7 miles.&nbsp; Elk Island, probably the largest island on the James, stretches for most of this length.&nbsp; You can paddle on the very narrow left side if you wish, just be wary of strainers where a small private bridge crosses over to the island.&nbsp; If you don’t go on the left side of Elk Island this is a fairly typical stretch of Piedmont James, with nice sycamores, silver maples, and farms.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Columbia to Maidens:</strong> This is about 15 miles.&nbsp; You can also put in/take out at Westview, a public landing on the Goochland side (north bank), which is about 4 or 5 miles downstream of Cartersville.&nbsp; This is a pretty slow stretch of river, particularly in the summer, and the wind tends to blow upstream.&nbsp; I would recommend taking a day trip from Westview to Maidens, as a day trip from Columbia to Maidens would be quite long given the speed of the water.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Maidens to Watkins Landing:</strong> This is about a 10 mile stretch, with a sweet one lane bridge (route 310) at the women’s prison just a few miles down of Maidens and several large islands after that.&nbsp; Campsites abound.&nbsp; This is the prettiest stretch of the James in the lower, flatter, Piedmont section.&nbsp; This is a good daytrip.&nbsp; One could also take an overnight trip from Westview to Watkins Landing.&nbsp; Canoe downstream of Watkins Landing is not reccomended, as slackwater backs up at least 10 miles behind Bosher Dam.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Watkins Landing to Hugeuneot Flatwater is a painful flatwater strecth filled with motorboats, jet skis, and invasive McMansions. The only redeeming features are rope swings and tall trees to jump off on the Henrico County side. Portage Bosher Dam on the left. Note the fish ladder.</span></p>",,1,1,0,1,"2011-03-12 19:53:10",62,,"2012-01-07 17:53:58",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 19:53:10","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms',geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong> Pony Pasture to Reedy Creek:</strong> This is a 4.5 mile class 1-2 run.&nbsp; If possible you should run this stretch with someone who’s been there before, as there is a certain route which is most passable at normal (3-6ft) water levels.&nbsp; Above 6 feet this stretch is more challenging, particularly in Mitchell’s Gut rapid.&nbsp; Do not run this or any other part of the downtown James section above 9 feet unless you’re an expert in a closed boat.&nbsp; Make sure you don’t miss the Reedy Creek takeout.&nbsp; The bridges you’ll go under are, in order, Powhite Parkway, a tall concrete arch rail bridge, and Boulevard (aka the Nickel Bridge).&nbsp; After a few small riffles below the put in, there is a 1.5 mile flat stretch before reaching Powhite Ledges, just upstream of Powhite Parkway.&nbsp; Run this down the middle.&nbsp; The next rapid, Choo Choo, is near the middle of the river just downstream of the conrete arch bridge.&nbsp; The rapid flows southeast and is not visible until you’re close to it, and may be difficult to locate for someone visiting the first time.&nbsp; It is the main channel.&nbsp; This is a class 1+.&nbsp; Eddy out on the right to check out the island and perhaps walk up above the rapid and float through it on an inner tube or in a life jacket, not recommended at low water without an inner tube because you’ll bump rocks.&nbsp; Below Choo Choo go far river right for the largest channel, running over a very low dam and pipeline, or down the middle of the river for a trickier, shallower route.&nbsp; Then you’ll go under the Nickel Bridge, which is a green steel truss.&nbsp; After the Nickel Bridge get to river right (though not to the tiny channel at the far right) and follow the main channel through two series of wave trains.&nbsp; The waves in the second series are bigger, and will get water in a canoe at levels of 5.5 feet or higher.&nbsp; This is Mitchell’s Gut rapid.&nbsp; Then get over to the far right to take out at Reedy Creek, which is hidden from the main channel of the river by islands.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms',geneva;""><strong>Reedy Creek to End of Fall Line:</strong></span></span><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""> This is a class 3-4 advanced section. Severity of rapids in this stretch depends greatly on water level.&nbsp; At levels of 3.5 feet and below on the Westham gauge most rapids have opportunities to recover, while levels of 6 feet or higher will produce more continuous traditions with substantially larger waves and holes.&nbsp; Paddling at 9 feet or above requires a permit from the fire station, and nobody without a bombproof roll and extensive experience on the river should be on the downtown James at that level or higher.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Regardless of water level, open boats may take on significant volumes of water, so be sure to have whitewater flotation.&nbsp; After leaving Reedy Creek, or continuing from the Mitchells Gut rapid upstream of Reedy Creek, stay on river right, approaching the head of Belle Isle.&nbsp; On river left are the remains of a dam; if you stay to the right you will approach First Break Rapids, where the main channel of the James cuts left/north next to Belle Isle, heading toward Hollywood rapids.&nbsp; First Break has nice surfing waves, including fairly long waves suitable for front surfing tandem boats around 6 feet.&nbsp; Hollywood Cemetery is visible on the hill in front of you as you enter First Break, which is an easy wave train at levels around four feet on the Westham gauge.&nbsp; Note that the right channel around Belle Isle is not canoeable except at high water.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">After First Break, stay close to the right bank, which is Belle Isle.&nbsp; Approximately 200&nbsp; yards downstream of First Break you will pass little ledges and holes, including the holes Flipper and Stripper, which is the signal that you are approaching Hollywood.&nbsp; For open boats, thread the needle between holes to avoid taking water before Hollywood.&nbsp; There is a short break between these ledges and the main drop at Hollywood; use it to take out and scout Hollywood.&nbsp; Hollywood’s hole is more powerful than it looks.&nbsp; Enter on the left side of the main tongue, then be ready to draw left to avoid getting pinned on a rock downstream.&nbsp; Be aware that there are other submerged pinning rocks near the main flow downstream of Hollywood; if you flip and your boat doesn’t have flotation it will probably wrap around one of these.&nbsp; </span><br /><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">After Hollywood stay in the current and aim for a break in what used to be a pedestrian walkway over an old VEPCO dam, below the Lee Bridge and walkway suspended from it.&nbsp; The walkway now ends about 4 piers out in the river from Browns Island, which will be on your left.&nbsp; Run just to the right of the observation deck that is the terminus of that walkway.&nbsp; This area has a few minor drops.&nbsp; Within a couple hundred yards you will enter a boulder garden.&nbsp; The easiest line is on the right side of the main channel.&nbsp; This will carry you over Pipeline’s main drop, a roughly 4 foot drop into a hole that will swamp canoes without flotation.&nbsp; It is possible to skirt the main drop of Pipeline on the right side of the tongue, eddying out below the hole.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Be careful maneuvering toward that drop; there are tricky cross currents just above as a result of the water funneling into a narrower channel.&nbsp; Pipeline is the last rapid of the fall line, so you have plenty of flat water to recover your boat if you flip in it.&nbsp; The takeout is just downstream on your left; look for some wooden/concrete stairs, installed by the industrious James River Outdoor Coalition (JROC).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The description above is for the standard lines.&nbsp; Due to the width of the river, there are countless other alternatives, some of which are under the downtown James section of American Whitewater’s website.</span></p>",,1,1,0,1,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 19:16:27",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3""><strong>Rt 609 to Genito Road:</strong> This is an attractive, remote stretch of river with an extraordinary amount of wildlife.&nbsp; The water is flat but moves fairly quickly, so with relaxed paddling and breaks the trip will take approximately 3.5 to 4 hours.&nbsp; The Amelia State Wildlife Management Area lines much of the right side of the river, so wear blaze orange if paddling during hunting season.&nbsp; There are some attractive woods to explore on this state-owned land, including what appear to be remains of fortifications and an old home site on a hill near the river.&nbsp; Toward the end of this trip you will see a white house, and shortly downstream a small dock on the right.&nbsp; From this dock you can walk 1/4 mile up a small stream to the lake in the Wildlife Management Area.&nbsp; This meadow near the dock is a nice place to take a break and explore, particularly if it is a Sunday and people aren't hunting.&nbsp; I would not recommend walking around in the woods on a Saturday in hunting season.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"">The Blackwater is an extraordinarily remote swampy river in southeastern Virginia, flowing parallel to Rt 460 (but not too close to it) before turning south and going through Franklin.&nbsp; Many stretches of this make for fantastic winter day trips or camping trips.&nbsp; There are no rapids, but in the upper reaches you will have to haul over a number of logs.&nbsp; The wildlife is fantastic.&nbsp; There are many mature bald cypresses and a good number of other hardwoods, one of which is the widest hollow tree I’ve ever seen.&nbsp; I highly recommend the Blackwater if you want to see what southeast Virginia looked like before the whites drained, ditched, and developed it.&nbsp; Few rivers are this beautiful and untraveled.&nbsp; There are few places I’d rather be in the wintertime.&nbsp; Don’t go when there are mosquitoes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"">Note that there is a good long stretch I haven’t explored stretching from about Laurel Springs Road to Broadwater Road.&nbsp; This is probably a real nice piece of river, though more log jammed and congested in the upper part.&nbsp; The 10 to 20 miles above Broadwater would probably not be too log jammed, judging by the river width/volume at Broadwater.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;""><strong>Hines Road to Laurel Spring Road:</strong> For folks who love tiny rivers and don’t mind a few portages, put in at Hines Road or Alden Road and go to Laurel Springs Road.&nbsp; You will have to portage a good deal, sometimes for dozens of yards, but it is worth it for the swamp.&nbsp; Make sure you go in the winter after a rainy spell.&nbsp; Even a fairly short stretch this high up will take a long time because of log jams.&nbsp; Wear high rubber boots.&nbsp; This stretch is not for the faint of heart.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;""><strong>Laurel Spring Road to Broadwater Road:</strong> This is a long stretch that I haven’t run, appears to be significantly easier to navigate than above Laurel Spring Road.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;""><strong>Broadwater Road to Route 603 Unity Road:</strong> Bald cypresses and winding blackwater dominate this trip, which is about 14 miles and takes two days.&nbsp; You will need to slide over many logs, but shouldn’t have to get out of the boat very much.&nbsp; The banks are quite pretty when the main channel swings up against them, with mature pine and holly.&nbsp; I highly recommend stopping on the left bank 6 river miles below Rt 460 to get out and hike to the pine savanna managed by Old Dominion University with controlled burns.&nbsp; Here you will see what much of the southeastern part of the state looked like when settlers arrived.&nbsp; Due to the winding nature of the river, it will be quite difficult to estimate when you have gone 6 river miles without using a GPS.&nbsp; However, one way you can tell is when the main current runs up against the left bank for a spell and all the swamp is on your right. &nbsp;If you get to the point where the river channelizes you’ve gone a bit too far, but might could pull up on the left bank and walk back upriver to find the pine savannah.&nbsp; The really nice part of the savannah is about a quarter to half mile to the east of the river.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a little dirt road that goes there, or you can bushwhack through the forest; just be prepared to get your feet wet.&nbsp; You will know when you’ve arrived at the savannah because there will be many pines with an extremely open, grassy understory.&nbsp; You’ll be able to see the burn marks on the trees.&nbsp; Note the giant pinecones on the ground.&nbsp; I wonder how large pines get in an environment like this.&nbsp; I doubt these are fully grown, but they sure are beautiful.&nbsp; After checking out this forest and getting back in your boat you are a few miles from the end of the trip, much of which is in a river with a channel.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;""><strong>Route 603 to Franklin:</strong> I haven’t canoed this, but the river appears to widen considerably and have much less swamp and much more channel.&nbsp; Because the swamp is the prettiest, most mysterious part, I’d recommend focusing the exploration in areas between the headwaters and 603.</span></p>",,1,1,0,4,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 17:44:13",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Buffalo Creek drains southern Rockbridge County, with headwaters in and around Purgatory Mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;It joins Colliers Creek near Effinger, doubles in size, and then joins the Maury River between Buena Vista and Glasgow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessedly free of development, passing through beautiful farms and past small curving rock bluffs, Buffalo Creek is one of the more scenic trips in Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has nearly constant rapids near its confluence with Colliers Creek and between Interstate 81 and the Maury, with a few miles of riffles in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bed that is either pebbly or highly irregular bedrock, Buffalo Creek takes significant precipitation to run comfortably, but should be a top priority whenever it does.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Maury is around 1,200 cfs on the Rockbridge Baths gauge, or if the Kerrs Creek gauge is around 300 cfs, or if the Piney River is well over 300 cfs, then Buffalo Creek is probably running.</span></p>

Effinger is located approximately 15 minutes west of Lexington.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" size=""3""><strong>Murat:</strong> There is a roadside put in on the north side of Buffalo Creek on Rt 251 approximately 3 miles downstream of Effinger, in the hamlet of Murat.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms',geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" size=""3"">Murat to Bunker Hill Road: </span></strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" size=""3"">Below Murat the Buffalo has significantly reduced gradient, and the rapids decrease in frequency and severity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenery continues to be outstanding, and paddlers should stay alert for several low water bridges and at least two electric fences.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two low water bridges that one can float underneath at lower runnable levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two other bridges appear to be death traps, and should be portaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Novice paddlers must have a more experienced partner in their boats if running this section, as some of the low water bridges are located at the terminus of a wave train, such as a driveway and Bunker Hill Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 7 miles downstream of Murat, one will pass under Route 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the relatively flat water as the Buffalo wraps around Buffalo Bend, the creek drops precipitously over a two hundred or three hundred yard long series of ledges where Interstate 81 crosses the creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffalo Creek spreads out over these ledges, so at most water levels capsized paddlers will have time to recover boats, but at high water it would be a very long swim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also be aware that the pillars for the I-81 bridge can be a hazard: this is near the top of the rapid.&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through the pillars, the water drops over two foot ledges before concentrating in a series of pour-overs on river right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many more ledges follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mile or so one will see a road on river left.&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing this road be prepared to take out above Bunker Hill Road, an extremely dangerous low water bridge located in the middle of a rapid.&nbsp;&nbsp;At most runnable levels, this bridge is right at water level, with no eddies near it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that river left has the best portage.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Bullpasture Gorge:</strong> Above the Highland Wildlife Management Area there are some class 1 and 2 ledges and small rock gardens.&nbsp; Immediately below the footbridge at the Highland Wildlife Management Area is a chute with a good wave train, followed by a quarter to half mile or relatively flat water through a beautiful rocky gorge.&nbsp; Then the Bullpasture falls through many class 2 rock gardens, which are very technical at lower water levels, before reaching its finale with Double Ledge rapid and a subsequent falls.&nbsp; Double Ledge is recognizable because it is the first clear horizon line on the river, and has a large boulder on center right about halfway through the rapid.&nbsp; Pull out on the right to scout and make sure no strainers are in the rapid.&nbsp; Run Double Ledge down the middle at lower water levels, but be aware that the hole at the bottom will cover you up as the water level gets higher.&nbsp; Immediately after Double Ledge is a five foot high ledge.&nbsp; On the right is a two step drop with a nasty pinning rock near the middle of it.&nbsp; If running the right slot (which, from the river, seems like the logical route at lower water levels) be sure to stay on the right side of it to avoid the pinning rock.&nbsp; There are two other slots further left, both of which are sheer drops.&nbsp; The one in the middle has a deeper pool, and is more easily accessible.&nbsp; It can be run as low as 180 cfs or so, as can the right slot.&nbsp; Generally, if the Bullpasture has 200 cfs water levels are adequate.&nbsp; 180 cfs is a good bare minimum.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Cedar Creek is a little stream that flows out of a little valley right near West Virginia, then cuts across the Valley north of Strasburg to join the North Fork of the Shenandoah a few miles east of Route 11.&nbsp; At least these twenty plus miles of the river are navigable, and you could probably put in above Rt 55 if there was enough water to extend this trip.&nbsp; Cedar Creek has some of the strangest rocky banks in Virginia, many-layered and swept in broad curves and billows, in addition to the usual rocky cliffs.&nbsp; You’ll find some of the oldest cedars in the state along this creek, many of which grow from tiny cracks in rocky bluffs at the water’s edge.&nbsp; Hemlock groves appear along the banks periodically, and many of them appear to have dodged the adelgid or not been hit yet.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Some of the prettiest farms in the state are next to Cedar Creek, many of which have the Allegheny ridge as their backdrop.&nbsp; On an overnighter you can visit abandoned farm ruins, a fort nearly 300 years old, and a large cave, in addition to paddling one of the prettiest little creeks there is.&nbsp; The rapids are small with one exception, but because the creek is swift I would recommend having some flotation in the boat just in case.&nbsp; There are plenty of camping opportunities throughout this trip.&nbsp; Be careful not to pin on the low water bridges, of which there are several.&nbsp; There should be enough water to run Cedar Creek after a rain in the winter or spring—2 feet or so on the gauge.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 55:</strong> Heading west, cross Cedar Creek on 55, then take your first right onto a little gravel road, Star Tannery Road.&nbsp; About 30 yards later this gravel road runs up against Cedar Creek; put in here, parking between the road and the creek, being careful not to block the gate into the nearby field.&nbsp; This is an unofficial put in; my car was not ticketed or disturbed.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong></strong></span><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 628:</strong> There is no official put in.&nbsp; You could ask permission of the folks in the white house on the north side of the road, east side of the river, (the house with the old fort in front of it) for permission to put in through their yard.&nbsp; They’re nice folks.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 11:</strong> There is an official put in on the north bank of the river.&nbsp; It may be confusing to find because it appears to be in the middle of divided Rt 11.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Long Meadow Road:</strong> There is a good, semi-official put in where Long Meadow Road runs directly adjacent to the North Fork of the Shenandoah, located immediately below the confluence of Cedar Creek and the North Fork.&nbsp; Park along the road next to the big square rocks; the put in is where the road comes down nearly to the level of the river.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms',geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Sections of River to Run:</strong></span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Route 55 to Middle Road/Rt 628:</strong> The stream starts out only about 20 feet wide.&nbsp; Pretty soon you leave the little Cedar Creek Valley that runs parallel to the Shenandoah Valley and cut east across the Shenandoah Valley.&nbsp; Check out the views of North Mountain to your left and the many beautiful hemlock and cedar groves as well as the rocky cliffs.&nbsp; About 2/3 of the way through this section you’ll need to portage a low water bridge, Fromans Road.&nbsp; The rapids are no larger than little class 1s.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">This is one of the prettiest stretches of stream in the state.&nbsp; At the end of the run you’ll come to some giant boulders in the middle of the stream, as Rt 628 appears in front of you, a fairly new steel and concrete span.&nbsp; Shortly before you see the bridge you will see the gauge; a&nbsp; concrete tower next to the river.&nbsp; Take caution here as the boulders ahead often pick up strainers.&nbsp; Eddy out on the left bank just above the bridge to check out Fort Stevens, a hexagonal fort up on the hill.&nbsp; Please ask permission at the white house before walking around the fort, as it is on their property.&nbsp; They probably will say yes; please ask permission so they don’t post the land and prevent future boaters from checking out the fort.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Middle Road to Route 11: </strong>The stream gets a little bigger but no less pretty.&nbsp; There are many camping opportunities about a mile below Middle Road on river right, including a beautiful shaded, grassy bank on an old farm, where a cedar forest is now growing up on the hills.&nbsp; You’ll go under a bridge about halfway through this stretch.&nbsp; Just a mile or so above Rt 11 you will see Panther Cave on your left.&nbsp; This is by far the largest cave I’ve seen along any Virginia river.&nbsp; Take out on river left after passing under the first half of Rt 11.&nbsp; There is a private campground at the Rt 11 crossing of the river, on the west side of the road, should you need to use it.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 11 to Long Meadow Road: </strong>This is a short stretch of river.&nbsp; Cedar Creek flattens out considerably, except for the big rapid just above Bowman Mill Road.&nbsp; This rapid, a couple miles into the trip, can sneak up on you pretty easily.&nbsp; At higher water levels you can run it just about anywhere.&nbsp; It is probably a 5 foot high bumpy drop, not too difficult as long as you keep the boat straight.&nbsp; Center right is probably a more clear line than anywhere else, and the only runnable route at lower water levels.&nbsp; This is by far the largest rapid on Cedar Creek.&nbsp; Portage Bowman Mill road (a low water bridge), then proceed to the confluence and go about 100 yards downstream on the N. Fork before taking out on the left.&nbsp; Note the incredible views of Massanutten from the N. Fork.</span></p>",,1,1,0,8,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 17:47:31",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">If I could run one river in the state for several days or more it would be the Clinch, which is unparalleled for scenery, remoteness, fishing, camping, and culture.&nbsp; The river cuts through very dramatic mountains, over exquisite ledges, through beautiful occasional farmland, alongside awe inspiring cliffs, and through some nice little towns.&nbsp; Rapids are manageable, but (only near St. Paul) surprisingly large considering the overall river gradient: the river tends to be flat for a spell and then abruptly spill over a ledge.&nbsp; Canoeists with some whitewater experience should be fine; tie in your gear and have flotation just in case.&nbsp; The only downside to running the Clinch is an AEP coal plant at Carbo.&nbsp; Note that Dominion Power is in the process of gaining approval to build a coal plant at St Paul, which will undoubtedly wreak havoc on the freshwater mussel population of the Clinch.&nbsp; The Clinch has at least 5 times as many species of freshwater mussels as does the entire continent of Europe.&nbsp; You can see these mussels particularly well in the vicinity of Pendleton Island and other areas downstream of Fort Blackmore.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Nash’s Ford to Cleveland:</strong> From Nash’s Ford to Cleveland you’ll find beautiful scenery, countless campsites, and tons of fish.&nbsp; There are no difficult rapids.&nbsp; There is a bridge about halfway through this 9 mile or so trip.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Cleveland to St. Paul:</strong> This is a pretty stretch of river with great fishing and plenty of camping opportunities.&nbsp; After putting in at the ball field the river is slow and peaceful for a ways with thick vegetation all around, just what heaven looks like.&nbsp; Later on you’ll go through some little ledges with some underwater boulders, a good fishing spot.&nbsp; Carbo power plant is about a third of the way through the trip, and is the one obscenity on an otherwise flawless stretch of river.&nbsp; Revel in the remote valley after the power plant.&nbsp; You could pick up some vittles in St. Paul if need be.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>St. Paul to Carfax:</strong> It would be impossible for anywhere on earth to be more beautiful than this stretch of river, which flows past cliffs interspersed with fields.&nbsp; There are beautiful boulder gardens and fun class 2 rapids.&nbsp; The first significant rapid is immediately after the Route 58 bridge in St. Paul.&nbsp; It is a slightly complex, sloping, river-wide ledge of three or four feet.&nbsp; At lower water levels this rapid can be tricky because the current will tend to run diagonally from left to right in the main center drop.&nbsp; If you flip in this rapid, get to shore on the left quickly because after an initial pool the river has vertical sides with no bank before another riffle.&nbsp; Approximately three miles after the first ledge there is another abrupt, river wide ledge.&nbsp; At lower water levels the best route is toward the left; at medium water levels run the sloping routes in the middle.&nbsp; After three more miles or so you’ll notice the railroad on the left go into a tunnel.&nbsp; Watch out and get over to the river right; you’re approaching a very dangerous rapid with numerous undercut rocks.&nbsp; Do not run this rapid.&nbsp; The left channel, which appears runnable from the river, turns out to be a sieve.&nbsp; While it may not be deadly you’re liable to pin your boat.&nbsp; The center channel also appears to be runnable from above but runs out of water in the drop because it goes under the big boulder in the middle of the river.&nbsp; The right slot, which appears to have the most water, funnels under a nasty diagonal undercut that would appear to have the potential to trap unwary boats and people indefinitely.&nbsp; After this rapid there are some nice campsites in the short, flat stretch of river before you reach Carfax.&nbsp; You’re at Carfax when you see a small stream entering on the right, under a rail bridge, after which the river goes down a riffle next to a cliff on the left.&nbsp; There is no bridge here.&nbsp; There is no bridge at all between St. Paul and Dungannon, despite the alleged Route 611 crossing on the DeLorme Atlas and Gazetteer.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Carfax to Dungannon:</strong> The prettiest cliffs on the Clinch are just downstream of Carfax, and many of them have great campsites near them. There is also a riverside cave across the way from a pretty beach campsite about halfway between Carfax and Dungannon.&nbsp; The river flattens out and opens up, going over several gravel bars, before Dungannon.&nbsp; This is one of the prettiest stretches of river in all of Virginia.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Dungannon to Fort Blackmore:</strong> This long, flat stretch of river is not recommended for canoeing except as part of a longer trip on the Clinch; the scenery does not compare to other sections of river.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Fort Blackmore to Hill Station: </strong>Immediately below Fort Blackmore is Pendleton Island, which is actually a series of islands owned by the Nature Conservancy.&nbsp; You’ll see some of the best freshwater mussel populations in the state right here, so be careful not to disturb them.&nbsp; Good scenery continues downstream.&nbsp; There is a great rocky beach/grassy ledge campsite about 2/3 of the way from Fort Blackmore to Hill Station, located within view of the rail trestle.&nbsp; Note that Hill Station is called “Hill” on the Atlas and Gazetteer.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Hill Station to Clinchport:</strong> Although Route 65 follows the river closely for this stretch the river is quite pretty, and traffic is generally not heavy or audible.&nbsp; There is roadside camping in Clinchport, right off Route 65 about a half mile east of Route 23, in addition to plenty of other camping on river left.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Clinchport to Route 627:</strong> After Clinchport the river turns south and traverses a beautiful pass; unfortunately the high volume four lane Route 23 follows the river closely for two miles here.&nbsp; After turning back to the southwest the scenery remains excellent without the roadnoise.&nbsp; However, small roads on either side of the river, in addition to a paucity of islands, make camping difficult (there are just a few sites, many of them roadside on the south side of the river) from Route 23 to the Tennessee border.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Route 627 to Kyles Ford:</strong> There is a small roadside put in on the south side of the river, off Route 627, shortly before the state line.&nbsp; Shortly after this put in the road on river right ends, offering many camping opportunities on the right.&nbsp; Fishing near the state line and south is superb.&nbsp; You’ll cross under a small bridge in Tennessee about 1/3 of the way to Kyles Ford.&nbsp; About 3 miles above Kyles Ford is a series of beautiful ledges with cliffs on the left.&nbsp; These easy class 1 rapids have some of the prettier scenery along the Clinch.&nbsp; Campers should use the river right beach campsites before the ledges or the state-owned island half a mile below them because there is no camping next to the rapids, due to high cliffs on the right and a small road on the left.&nbsp; Kyles Ford has the only store below St. Paul, located on Route 72 on river right.&nbsp; The takeout can be recognized by a set of wide concrete stairs on the right, a hundred yards above the bridge.</span></p>",,1,1,0,10,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 17:48:17",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The Fall Line of the Chickahominy lies between Old Washington Highway and Rt 1. The Chickahominy is also runnable from Rt 156 Airport Rd on the Henrico/Hanover border all the way to its confluence with the James at the border of Charles City/James City County (despite a large portage around Walker Dam).&nbsp; Most folks don’t know that this is the most remote, undisturbed river in the metro area, with the possible exception of the Blackwater.&nbsp; Amidst the golf course sprawl of New Kent and the sprawl of Henrico’s east end, the Chickahominy is home to centuries-old bald cypresses, one of which is six feet in diameter.&nbsp; Except at the road crossings you’re not likely to see signs of savagery on this river.&nbsp; You will see wildlife, nearly opaque black water, and endless swamp.&nbsp; Go in the winter or early spring, when the water is relatively high and there aren’t mosquitoes.&nbsp; Wear waterproof boots if possible, and plan on dragging over at least a couple of downed trees per mile.&nbsp; About 8 miles to 10 miles is a good day trip, because dragging over logs slows the pace.&nbsp; The current is very slow, the gradient flat.&nbsp; There are no rapids.&nbsp; You could camp in this section.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms',geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Old Washington Highway to Rt 1: </span></strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Ran in Fall 2006 following a Nor’easter that provided an inch of rain.&nbsp; Current: Medium to Fast.&nbsp; This is a short trip of approximately three miles that runs over the fall line section of the river.&nbsp; I ran this section solo in a 15’ Old Town Camper canoe.&nbsp; Put in below the large mill dam near Old Washington Highway.&nbsp; This is not a good put-in with challenges for both parking and river access.&nbsp; Trip started with the river well out of its banks and several downed trees.&nbsp; In a quarter mile you pass under a power line and a small private bridge. Here the river returns to the confines of its banks and narrows to about 15 feet.&nbsp; The river is small enough that the paddler is virtually enclosed in a canopy of trees.&nbsp; The scenery consists of forests on each side with an occasional house in view.&nbsp; Downed trees are abundant throughout the entire trip, about half can be ducked under and half require a portage.&nbsp; River continues at a decent pace until you reach the next set of power lines.&nbsp; The power lines here follow the old Ashland Richmond trolley line right of way and remnants of the old bridge are still present.&nbsp; This marks the halfway point of the trip. The next set of power lines marks the start of the fall line.&nbsp; The first rapids consist of surprisingly big wave trains and small class I ledges. Rocks also begin to appear.&nbsp; None of the rapids are particularly hard to navigate but the power of the river and the height of the waves is impressive.&nbsp; Eventually, the paddler approaches the largest rapid of the trip which consists of a I+ ledge with the best passage between two rocks on river left.&nbsp; The rapid is recognized by a 25 foot rocky bluff overlooking a large eddy pool below the rapid.&nbsp; Here the river makes a sharp left turn and after a couple more ledges and strainers the paddler cruises under the final set of power lines and the traffic of Route One is heard in the distance.&nbsp; Take out river right upstream of the Route one bridge.&nbsp; There are several small businesses in the area where the take out vehicle can be left.</span></p>

<p><strong><span class=""blog"" style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Overview:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The Cowpasture has one of the least inhabited watersheds in Virginia.&nbsp; With an astonishing variety of terrain, from towering shale cliffs to verdant pastures, it is one of the most spectacular canoeing destinations in Virginia.&nbsp; Although the Cowpasture, like the Jackson, is afflicted by private ownership for much of its length, there are plenty of campgrounds, either on unposted private land or one of the many places where George Washington National Forest abuts the river.&nbsp; It is extremely rare to find such a scenic, varied, unspoiled river.&nbsp; There are only two significant rapids between Rt 614 and the James River: one near Rt 614, and one a mile and a half or so downstream of Griffith Ford, so the Cowpasture has fairly safe trips at reasonable water levels, even in cold weather.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Recommended Trips:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(overnighter): First 614 bridge north of Williamsville to Route 629 or Route 39.&nbsp; At approximately 4 feet on the Clifton Forge gauge for the Cowpasture, this is a leisurely 2 day trip if you get an early start.&nbsp; If you’re scraping then it will probably take a full 2 days, particularly in winter.&nbsp; Plan on taking a little water in a few wave trains, and tie your gear in just in case.&nbsp; Scenery is spectacular, equal to any other 2 day trip in Virginia.&nbsp; Rt 629 may be an easier takeout than Rt 39, as there is nowhere to park at Rt 39.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(day trip): Williamsville to 1st Rt 625 bridge north of Rt 39.&nbsp; This would be a relatively long day trip at lower water levels, but includes a stunning array of landscapes.&nbsp; Put in on the Bullpasture in Williamsville (at the 614 bridge) and float just a quarter mile to the Cowpasture, or put in from FR 282, just south of Williamsville.&nbsp; Take out at your fourth bridge, after going through a deep rocky gorge with caves and overhanging cliffs.&nbsp; Be sure to take out at the southern 625 bridge; if you take out at the one a few miles north you’ll miss the gorge.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(4 day) Put in at first 614 bridge north of Williamsville and takeout at the Rt 220 bridge over the James in Iron Gate, one mile below the Cowpasture/Jackson confluence.&nbsp; Route 39 is the midpoint in this trip.&nbsp; The only hazard is a dam approximately 4 miles below Rt 39; I recommend a river right portage to avoid walking across someone’s lawn on the left.&nbsp; There is plenty of camping; look for small yellow signs or red stripes (both on trees along the river) to denote National Forest lands.&nbsp; Most of these are on river right, except for a recreation area off of Rt 632 between the Route 39 and Route 42 bridge, which also has a public put in.&nbsp; There is plenty of public and non-posted, secluded campsites to make this a spectacular four day trip.&nbsp; Plan on five days if you’re fishing very much.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(day trip) Put in at Rt 632 (from Route 42 follow sign to George Washington Forest Recreation Area) and take out at Griffith Ford, both public put ins/take outs.&nbsp; Leave the whole day for this very scenic float.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(overnight) Put in at Rt </span><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">632 and take out at the Rt 220 Iron Gate bridge over the James.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Liberty to Rt 614 bridge: This half day trip can be combined with a run down Shaws Fork, which joins the Cowpasture in Liberty.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Shaws Fork (Headwaters) to Rt 614 bridge above Williamsville:</strong>&nbsp; Probably by historical accident, the “Cowpasture” tributary is smaller than the “Shaws Fork” tributary where they cross under Route 250 in Highland County.&nbsp; During high water, a great trip runs from Headwaters (Rt 250) on Shaws Fork and continues on the Cowpasture past the crossroads of Liberty.&nbsp; See Shaws Fork entry for additional information on the upper section.&nbsp; Below Liberty, the Cowpasture passes over a couple Class I-II ledgy and boulder garden sections, and there is one braided spot that may be prone to catching strainers.&nbsp; This portion of the river is stunningly beautiful, with cliffs, hemlocks, sycamores, and occasional open pasture views.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Williamsville to Rt 39: </strong>Water levels at 2.75 feet are adequate from Williamsville to the James.&nbsp; Between Williamsville and Rt 39 there are a few ledges, and paddlers should stay alert for strainers that may require a short portage across a shoal, particularly on the outside of bends in the river.&nbsp; Below Williamsville the river becomes more placid but no less scenic, with a succession of stunning cliffs, hemlocks, cedars, and open fields.&nbsp; The water is a piercing blue green color, and completely clear.&nbsp; Shortly below Williamsville is National Forest land on both sides of the river, with good camping and access to the Jerkemtight National Forest area, approximately 17,000 acres of roadless area.&nbsp; A little further downriver there is National Forest land on river left, in the vicinity of the Rt 627 and Rt 678 bridges.&nbsp; After the river flows under Rt 625 for the first time (2nd 625 bridge as one would drive north from Rt 39) it passes through private land until going back under Rt 625 some 4 to 5 miles later.&nbsp; After going through a couple beautiful gorges and around a sharp bend, the river crosses back under Rt 625.&nbsp; Approximately a mile downstream there is another good campsite, a flat ledge on National Forest land.&nbsp; From Williamsville to Route 39, 500 cfs on the Clifton Forge gauge is adequate, although this will be rough for the first few miles south of Williamsville.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Route 39 to Griffith Ford/Rt 630:</strong> The Cowpasture between Rt 39 and Rt 42 is one of the most scenic stretches of river in the state.&nbsp; Good camping can be found at the National Forest Recreation Area (and put in) off Rt 632, and on the outside bend of the river near Rt 631 and Rt 652; look for a shelf with evergreens where a little tributary comes in near the head of the bend, at the base of Beards Mountain.&nbsp; There is also National Forest land on river left downstream of the Rt 42 bridge, part of the Rough Mountain Wilderness area.&nbsp; The scenery from Rt 42 to Griffith Ford is not as pretty as above Rt 42 due to more houses and proximity to a road.&nbsp; You’ll have arrived at Rt 630/Griffith Ford when you see a very well built VDOT pedestrian suspension bridge and a ford.&nbsp; This stretch of river usually has enough water during the winter and spring, barring droughts.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Griffith Ford to James River:</strong> Less than a mile below Griffith Ford the river passes under the first of three rail bridges.&nbsp; Tie in your gear and get your life jacket, because there is a double ledge between the first and second rail bridge that could prove treacherous at medium to higher water levels.&nbsp; The rapid is just upstream of the second rail bridge. &nbsp;It should be run far left at lower water levels to minimize scraping.&nbsp; Downstream of the third railroad bridge you’ll enter more National Forest, with one good campsite on river left before you are within hearing distance of I64.&nbsp; A mile or so after passing under I64, there is more good camping on river left at the end of a fairly large island, in a grassy field at the base of a beautiful bluff that is part of Anthony Knob.&nbsp; There is more camping just a couple miles downstream of there, on river right just after passing under the Rt 633 bridge.</span><i></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Liberty to Route 614 bridge/Patna:</strong> The diminutive Cowpasture joins Shaws Fork at the crossroads of Liberty in central Highland County. From that confluence it assumes the volume and characteristics of a mid-size Virginia mountain stream. In the first couple of miles below Liberty, the Cowpasture flows over many gravel bars and several enjoyable ledges. River-wide strainers are unusual, but there may be partial strainers in some parts of these class II ledges. In this area, the Cowpasture passes through a beautiful gorge with high cliffs on the left and attractive hemlock groves. A bit further downstream the valley opens up and the Cowpasture becomes somewhat braided. Expect to portage a strainer or two in this area, though they aren’t too dangerous due to the lower gradient. After this fairly brief, though still scenic, flat section the Cowpasture picks up speed as it passes under the upper Route 614 bridge. Between this first Route 614 bridge and Patna, the Cowpasture passes through some class II boulder gardens. The most exciting boulder garden occurs as the river runs up against the road on the left. This boulder garden is followed by a couple like it before the next Route 614 bridge, which is the last opportunity to take out before entering Bath County.</span></p>",,1,1,0,12,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 19:51:50",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p><strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" face=""Calibri, serif"">Rt 522 to Monumental Mills:</span> </strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" face=""Calibri, serif"">For the roughly 13 miles between Rt 522 and Monumental Mills, the Hazel River continues to display the outstanding scenic characteristics that attract paddlers to the Hughes and Thornton. It has countless small riffles and ledges (nothing exceeding class 1), beautiful rocky bluffs, some accompanied by stands of hemlocks, and a profusion of wildlife. The paddler is likely to see pileated, downy, and red bellied woodpeckers, and possibly a flicker. There are many Coopers hawks, great blue herons, kingfishers, and ducks, as well as wrens and other small birds that flit along the shoreline. I saw two foxes and a herd of deer as well on a recent spring trip.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" face=""Calibri, serif"">This trip takes approximately 5.5 hours if one is paddling most of the time; since this stream generally only has enough water after a rainy period in spring or winter one may want to paddle to stay warm. There is a bridge approximately 2/3 of the way through the trip, but unfortunately the lack of parking and access points precludes using it (Rt 738) as a take out. Near the end of the trip you will see a couple houses on the right and then reach a horizon line, which is a partially broken out dam. The landowner on the right side of the river has posted ""No Trespassing"" signs on dozens of rocks, trees, posts, and the remainder of the dam, precluding a safe portage on the topographically logical right hand side. Therefore one must portage on the left, lowering one's boat down the face of the dam (approximately 10 feet high), then climb down the dam (which is irregular, as it is constructed of rather small rocks) or climb down the rocky, steep left bank. At lower runnable levels there is no water going over the far left side of the dam; if you are floating down the Hazel and never come close to scraping on gravel bars this dam may have water going across the whole thing and the river left portage will be more dangerous. Note that the broken out portion of the middle of the dam appears to have a potentially terminal hydraulic, so do not run it at any water level. The landowner on the right monitored our portage to ensure we didn't trespass, and did not return a wave. Then he followed us along the river bank in his truck. At the edge of his property he has a large plywood sign decrying the United Nations, so perhaps he was concerned we were part of a foreign envoy investigating Culpeper County. Another sign on his property expressed his opposition to abortion, and left me hoping that at some point he will grant some of that same concern for the safety of his neighbors who paddle the Hazel and have to portage down the face of his dam. While it is not too unusual to find the occasional paranoid misanthrope who has retreated to a fortress in the country, this individual is by far the most extreme example I have encountered in Virginia, and is a black mark on the Piedmont and the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" face=""Calibri, serif"">After passing by this fellow's property you will pass under a bridge right before the Thornton/Hazel confluence (no access), then ferry across the Thornton to take out on river left right above a low water bridge that is likely to be a drowning hazard at runnable levels for the Thornton or Hazel. Despite one unpleasant landowner and portage this section of the Hazel is an unexpectedly scenic trip, one of which few paddlers are aware. If you have already paddled the classic Thornton and Hughes runs, this section of the Hazel (as well as the Rock Mills to Monumental Mills section of the Thornton) are well worth a trip, and are less than an hour and a half from the inner suburbs of Northern Virginia. If the gauge at Rixleyville is 500 cfs or 4 feet, or if the bridge gauge at Rt 522 is over 0, then there is enough water to avoid all but an occasional light scrape on a gravel bar.</span></p>",,1,1,0,14,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 17:50:37",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" face=""Times New Roman""><span size=""3"">The Laurel Fork of the Potomac is probably the most outstanding wilderness whitewater trip in Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the Route 642 put in located in northwest Highland County and the Vance Run Road take out in West Virginia, Laurel Fork cascades through a series of small gorges and open valleys, with towering cliffs and sublime meadows undisturbed by development, logging, or roads.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurel Fork is a joy to paddle not only because of the scenery and remoteness, but also because the streambed is generally bedrock, with a dazzling array of rapids ranging from long rock slides to abrupt ledges.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a watershed that has nearly undisturbed forest, water quality is very high, and supports a healthy native trout population.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapids, cliffs, hemlocks, rhododendron, wildflowers, meadows, and oaks along this stream are extraordinarily attractive and incomparably remote.&nbsp;&nbsp;This vast roadless tract of George Washington National Forest is by far the most remote tract of public land north of the James River, and is worth a visit for hiking or fishing if Laurel Fork isn’t running.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only downside to this incredible stream is the frequency of strainers, due to its small size.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these cannot detract from what may be the most rewarding trip in the Commonwealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurel Fork runs fairly frequently because of its solid bedrock bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurel Fork gauge readings of 3 feet should be sufficient, if a bit scrapey, or just head out following a significant rain in Highland.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3""><strong>Route 642:</strong> From Bluegrass, follow Route 642 west.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will turn to gravel, then cross Lantz Mountain and Straight Fork.&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing Straight Fork (little more than a ditch), Route 642 will cross Middle Mountain, then descend to Laurel Fork.&nbsp;&nbsp;Park in public right of way next to the bridge, on the south/east side of the creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put in quickly and discreetly, as this area is in private property next to National Forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple small cabins at the put in.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3""><strong>Vance Run Road:</strong> From Route 644 in Virginia, turn left on Vance Run Road some two hundred yards after crossing into West Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small brown sign with a hiker on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This bridge is located right below the confluence of Laurel Fork and Straight Fork.&nbsp;&nbsp;Park in public right of way, using the gravel bar as a take out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong><span size=""3"">Section of River to Run:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><span size=""3"">At the put in Laurel Fork is narrower than most solo canoes are long.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first couple of miles it passes over many small gravel bars with several strainers that should be fairly easy to see and&nbsp;</span>avoid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately one and a half to two miles into the trip Bearwallow Run will enter from the left, the first major tributary.&nbsp;There is also a small wooden sign on the left bank marking an intersection of Laurel Fork and Bearwallow trails.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this confluence Laurel Fork begins to pick up speed and gradient, and one needs to be more careful about strainers.&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there is a series of three strainers on a wide bend to the left approximately a mile below Bearwallow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final strainer is a large hemlock across a two foot ledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;At runnable levels some water goes over the top of this strainer, and the best approach is to charge and drop over this strainer, which creates a four foot high ledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that shallow water on the right could create piton potential.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3"">This drop initiates approximately five miles of fast, exciting whitewater.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous boulder gardens and ledges.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of note is a two to three foot ledge with a huge boulder on river left that blocks half the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;This boulder creates&nbsp;&nbsp;frothing hole in front of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Run right over the ledge at an angle to avoid getting stuck in this hole; it is not too turbulent at the edge, but one would not want to experiment with it in the middle or left.&nbsp;&nbsp;This rapid is near a trail intersection on the right; one may be able to see another small wooden sign and small footpath.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3"">Following this rapid and trail intersection, Laurel Fork cascades down a fifty yard long rock slide.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the water is on river left; stay in the right part of the channel to avoid scraping down the left bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;This cascade has no hazards or strange currents, at least not at lower runnable levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this slide Laurel Fork bends to the right, passing through some more minor rapids, then passing another trail intersection, this time on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a medium sized meadow on river right, on the inside of a bend.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tree across the river, but one can go over it on the right or under on the left; it is easily visible. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3"">Take heed at this point, however, because around the bend is a giant log jam.&nbsp;&nbsp;At lower runnable levels, one can slide up onto a gravel bar on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;At higher levels there would appear to be no significant eddies or places to take out.&nbsp;&nbsp;On river right is a small cleared channel, but this could clog at any time, and is tricky even in lower water.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this log jam were to be cleared away it would reveal a nice boulder garden with an undercut rock on the right side of the main chute. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3"">After passing this large log jam there is a series of great slides with terrific velocity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, all of a sudden, a significant horizon line appears, marking the largest rapid on Laurel Fork.&nbsp;&nbsp;This three tiered ledge has irregular angles that create tricky holes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Run right and brace well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Total drop is probably six to eight feet within a 25 foot period.&nbsp;&nbsp;After this awesome rapid Laurel Fork calms down for a spell, passing over several gravel bars, then careens toward a tremendous cliff before turning sharply right over a ledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful with this drop (recognizable by a large meadow on river right), as it has a tendency to pick up strainers that are not visible until one is toward the lower end of the boulder garden that precedes the ledge. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3"">Following this ledge, there are some spectacular cliffs on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurel Fork make several large bends, many of which have more enjoyable class II rapids, before becoming braided in its final half mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;This braided section has numerous strainers and is extremely dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick the biggest channel and be prepared to get out of the boat quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the misery is temporary, and Vance Run Road bridge comes immediately after the braided section of river ends.</span></p>

<span class=""blog"" face=""verdana, geneva"" size=""3"">
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Passage Creek drains beautiful Fort Valley, which is located between the two ridges of the northern portion of Massanutten.&nbsp; After meandering through the relatively level valley, Passage Creek drops precipitously through the gap near Elizabeth Furnance as it leaves Massanutten and enters the Shenandoah Valley.&nbsp; Shortly after leaving Massanutten Passage Creek joins the North Fork of the Shenandoah River.&nbsp; Passage Creek has outstanding mountain views both in Fort Valley and in the gorge.&nbsp; With native trout in its headwaters and stocked trout near Elizabeth Furnace, Passage Creek is a popular fishing destination.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Above Elizabeth Furnace, Passage Creek has relatively little gradient change, and is a calm paddle at lower water levels, roughly between 70 and 110 cubic feet per second.&nbsp; The gorge has much more challenging whitewater and requires higher water levels than the more level upstream portion of the stream.&nbsp; If running the gorge, use plenty of flotation and scout the several blind rapids to ensure strainers aren’t in them.&nbsp; In the upstream portion, be wary of low water bridges and the numerous barbed wire fences that farmers have strung across the creek; the upper section could be quite dangerous at higher water levels because of man-made hazards.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Numerous hiking trails are convenient to the river, as are Elizabeth Furnace and Camp Roosevelt state campgrounds.&nbsp; Located at the beginning of the gorge and the end of the flatter portion of Passage Creek, Elizabeth Furnace is the perfect location to stay if running the gorge one day and part of upper Passage Creek the next.&nbsp; This campground can fill up quickly in the warmer months; Camp Roosevelt, the first campground constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, located approximately 20 miles south of Elizabeth Furnace near the headwaters of Passage Creek, is less crowded.&nbsp; In the event that Elizabeth Furnace campground is full, there is informal camping near the Bear Wallow trailhead, which is directly across the street from Elizabeth Furnace campground.&nbsp; Route 678, which runs the length of Fort Valley, is a very scenic road and makes for a beautiful and efficient bicycle shuttle route.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Elizabeth Furnace:</strong> If camping here, it is possible to put in/take out by carrying approximately 40 yards to/from the campsite; choose a campsite close to the stream, away from the road.&nbsp; Alternatively, park and put in/take out at the day use picnic area located shortly downstream, which is easily visible and well-marked from Route 678.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Bucks Mill Road/Route 610:</strong> If driving from Elizabeth Furnace stay straight where Route 678 crosses Route 55, then bear right and continue to the low water bridge.&nbsp; Parking is extremely limited, in VDOT right of way next to the bridge.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Seven Fountains to Elizabeth Furnace:</strong> Excepting high water conditions, there are no rapids larger than a riffle.&nbsp; Several private low water bridges can be run at low water levels (roughly 70-85 cfs) but present dangerous hazards at higher levels.&nbsp; There are also several barbed wire fences across the river, which are often difficult to see, so be alert.&nbsp; Other than some areas of eroded banks, this is a very pretty stretch of calm, tiny river through a gorgeous valley.&nbsp; Seven Fountains to Elizabeth Furnace is a full day trip that can be shortened by putting in at Route 774 instead of Route 758.&nbsp; Note that Passage Creek is runnable about Seven Fountains depending on water levels, but the Seven Fountains to Elizabeth Furnace section is frequently runnable, needing only 70 cfs or more to be passable with few scrapes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Elizabeth Furnace to Bucks Mill Road:</strong> This section of river requires a minimum 100 cfs to avoid constant scraping.&nbsp; Shortly after leaving the picnic area at Elizabeth Furnace Passage Creek begins a precipitous descent to the Shenandoah Valley.&nbsp; Two of the three most difficult rapids in the gorge can be scouted easily from the road; one is located at the first bend where Passage runs next to the road below the picnic area, and the other at the lowest point in the gorge, where the creek runs up against a high rock wall that supports the road.&nbsp; Each of the three more difficult rapids in the gorge requires several quick, sharp turns at lower water levels to avoid pinning.&nbsp; Be sure to have flotation and good boat control.&nbsp; Be aware that after the first challenging rapid near the road Passage leaves the road and then goes around an island, raising the likelihood of strainers crossing the channel.&nbsp; The final rapid of the gorge requires a hard right turn as the current approaches the rock retaining wall on which Route 678 is located, due to a hard to spot pinning rock near the end of the rapid.&nbsp; After leaving the gorge be prepared for a dam located just below some cliffs on river right.&nbsp; Portage on the left.&nbsp; Mountain Road/Route 691, located shortly below the dam, could be used as a put in or takeout, as it is on public land.&nbsp; Below the dam Passage Creek continues over numerous little riffles on the way to the North Fork.&nbsp; There are no more hard rapids, and the only hazard other than possible strainers is the low water Bucks Mill/Route 610 bridge, which is immediately downstream of the railroad track and within sight of the North Fork.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Formerly known as the North River, the Maury flows from Goshen through Lexington and Buena Vista before joining the James at Glasgow, just west of the Blue Ridge.&nbsp; With the right boat and skills, one could float from the beginning of the Maury to the James in three days; the river is approximately 45 miles long, and extraordinarily beautiful the entire way.&nbsp; From the spectacular Goshen Pass to extensive caves to the awe inspiring confluence with the James, the Maury is a stunningly beautiful river.&nbsp; Except in flood, the water is between emerald and turquoise, and extremely clear.&nbsp; Rocky bluffs, mountain views, cascading side tributaries, caves, and dignified old farmhouses accompany the traveler along the river.&nbsp; Two dams, one in Lexington and one in Buena Vista, are the only scars on an otherwise spectacular stretch of river, and fortunately these dams are not large enough to create particularly long stretches of slackwater. However, they are a pain in the neck to portage. Goshen Pass is probably the best midsize river day trip in the state for skilled canoeists, and the float camping trip from Rockbridge Baths to either Lexington or Buena Vista is one of the prettiest overnighters in the state.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Goshen Pass</strong><strong> </strong>is one of the premier whitewater runs in Virginia, with numerous and varied rapids, outstanding scenery, and easy access.&nbsp; Although locals run the river down at least as low as 250cfs, a comfortable minimum level is 500-550cfs.&nbsp; The river probably flows at this level or higher at least 75-100 days per year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">If you put in at the swinging bridge and the Goshen Wildlife Management Area you will have a short period of flat water, then a few Class I drops before entering Class II boulder gardens which are near a small pull off for Route 39 that is an alternative put in.&nbsp; This first set of decent boulder gardens is passable on river right at lower levels, but watch for rocks just below the surface of what otherwise is an open channel.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Enjoyable Class II boulder gardens continue for the next mile or so as the river makes a right and then left hand bend.&nbsp; After the river bends back left you will pass through a short pool and see a large rock in the middle of the river ahead of you, which is a good signal you are approaching Devils Kitchen (III+/IV).&nbsp; Pull over on the gravel bar on the left bank to scout this rapid if you have not run it before.&nbsp; The simplest line at lower (say 500-650 cfs) is to start on river left, catching eddies behind the large river left boulder you probably stood on or near while scouting.&nbsp; Then you will drop into a chute and work hard right across divided currents through numerous boulders, aiming more or less at the large boulder in the middle of the river.&nbsp; If you are on line you will end up in the middle of the river below the large boulder, which is on the right hand side of the main channel.&nbsp; From there it is a relatively straight shot to the bottom, then eddy out right to make sure everyone else made it.&nbsp; At medium levels it is possible to start river right, run right of the boulder, then cut behind it and make a hard right turn to reenter the main flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; At medium-high levels you can run down the right bank the whole way, or start center right and go straight down.&nbsp; Do not enter the rapid directly upstream of the large boulder in the middle, as it tends to catch strainers and has killed people who washed into it.&nbsp; Nor should you be playing around in front of it or attempting to ferry back and forth in front of it.&nbsp; Devils Kitchen is the hardest rapid in Goshen Pass, particularly for longer open boats.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Below Devils Kitchen you will float through a relatively straight section of river with, surprise, more boulder gardens, none of which are as steep or technical as Devils Kitchen.&nbsp; Soon you will see a large concrete retaining wall looming high over the river’s right bank, which indicates you are approaching Corner Rapid, the second-hardest rapid in Goshen.&nbsp; Corner is boulder-choked on river right with a stout pourover on river left.&nbsp; Below the pourover the river is shallow on the left side, so the key is to go over the pourover and then work right back into the main current.&nbsp; The bottom of the drop can be bony at lower levels, at which it makes sense to run closer to the rock in the middle of the current that creates a nice boof pourover.&nbsp; 13 foot canoes can get completely airborne off this boof, which is the cleanest way to run Corner.</span><br /><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Below Corner is an unusual sloping rock wall on river right which creates unusual waves and trick opportunities.&nbsp; Only one ledgy rapid after that you will enter Indian Pool, a long pool with road access.&nbsp; This is a good takeout if you’re running laps on Goshen Pass, or if levels are low.&nbsp; There are entertaining rapids and surf holes below here but they are shallower as the river becomes more cobbly.&nbsp; If you continue past Indian Pool there is a roadside takeout on the right upstream of Rockbridge Baths.&nbsp; Paddlers also can continue to Rockbridge Paths, passing over the unusual Lava Falls (a rather bony sloping four to five foot drop), and take out behind the old Post Office on river left or the road pull off on river right.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rockbridge Baths to Lexington:</strong> Put in at Rockbridge Baths and run to the takeout just above the Route 60 bridge to the west of Buena Vista.&nbsp; This is about 17 miles of median paced water.&nbsp; The views are extraordinary most of the way, marred by only a little development, and include high rock cliffs, hemlock groves, deep clear water, and sparkling ledges. &nbsp;There are plenty of campsites available.&nbsp; There are at least 6 large caves visible from the river, some of which are quite beautiful inside.&nbsp; Do not touch the mineral formations in the caves, and be very quiet; if you wake bats from hibernation they will die.&nbsp; Portage the dam in Lexington on river right, through the local park (if you want to do a shorter overnighter this park is an alternate take out). Class II-III. Running this section in an open boat at 5 ft on the Buena Vista Gauge was a scary experience and is not reccomended, lots of holes form.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Lexington to Buena Vista:</strong> This is a 8 mile trip.&nbsp; There is a long island where the Maury goes under I81.&nbsp; There are nice campsites at the head of it, before you encounter the interstate, and before the interstate is audible.&nbsp; Also note the extraordinarily beautiful confluence of the South River with the Maury, which is located a few miles downstream of I81.&nbsp; Take out on river left at a public boat landing above the Route 60 bridge.</span></p>

The ability to turn quickly in a rapid is essential. It is very possible to pin a boat here, so be ready.&nbsp; Other than a couple of tight rapids in the upper portion of the run the rapids are fairly easy, except for a quick drop over a ledge right under the bridge (Millington Road) that marks the halfway point in the trip.&nbsp; You could take out at Millington, but wouldn’t want to because you’d miss more beautiful river.&nbsp; I’d recommend taking out at 601 on river right just above the bridge, where some camp has a little pull off.&nbsp; Do not park here, however, as it’d block their gate.&nbsp; Run this in spring for outstanding displays of wildflowers, which burst from cliff crannies and sandy banks alike.</span></p>",,1,1,0,19,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 17:57:16",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Buck/Ivanhoe to Austinville:</strong> Except for the trailers in Ivanhoe this is a scenic stretch of river with only small rapids.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Austinville to New River State Park:</strong> This stretch of the New is placid except for a class 2 rapid just upstream of the New River State Park.&nbsp; If you’re planning on taking out at the State Park, be sure to get over to river right quickly after the rapid.&nbsp; There are cheap campsites at New River State Park, both on the bank and on Bakers Island, a beautiful island just above Fosters Falls.&nbsp; Bakers Island may have the best campsites of any State Park in Virginia, but you’ll need a boat to reach them.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>New River State Park to Allisonia: </strong>Immediately after putting in at New River State Park the canoeist will need to navigate Fosters Falls, a class 2 series of drops several feet high that can be tricky.&nbsp; At lower water levels start down the falls on river left, making your way to the right, following the main current.&nbsp; At higher water levels it would not be necessary to make this diagonal maneuver.&nbsp; Fosters Falls is by far the largest rapid on this stretch, and the river becomes more placid until it backs up in Claytor Lake just before the Allisonia take out.&nbsp; Running from the State Park to Allisonia will probably take most of the day.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Whitethorne to Big Falls:</strong> Putting in at Whitethorne is not recommended for canoes because there are several miles of flatwater populated with motorboats before the New starts its descent to Big Falls; for those wishing to run Big Falls, it is preferable to put in from the roadside of Routes 600 (west side of river) or 625 (east side of river).&nbsp; There are outstanding views of the pass for the mile or so above Big Falls.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Big Falls to Eggleston:</strong> Big Falls is a class 2 drop, and by far the largest between Whitethorne and Pearisburg.&nbsp; It can be run easily by starting on river right and following the current toward the middle of the river, avoiding any precipitous drops.&nbsp; Or one can run over a more abrupt double ledge center left.&nbsp; I would recommend scouting your route, because not all of them are clean and it is hard to see down them from upriver.&nbsp; Campers should run river right if they wish to avoid flipping or taking much water.&nbsp; Below Big Falls the New maintains good velocity most of the way to Eggleston, passing through a beautiful gorge.&nbsp; There is roadside camping on river right near Route 625, which is very convenient for folks arriving at night to start a trip the next day.&nbsp; Fishing in this section is fantastic, though you’ll have plenty of competition.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Eggleston to Pembroke:</strong> After the river makes a big bend to the right, look to your left where a combination of spires, cliffs, caves, and a natural arch make for one of the prettiest rock formations on the river.&nbsp; This formation is less than a mile downstream of the Eggleston bridge.&nbsp; Downstream cliffs line the river, which makes several deep bends as it progresses to Pearisburg.&nbsp; There are very deep pools and rocky shelter along the river’s outer bends for fishing.&nbsp; The only negative aspect of this stretch of river are some hideous homes on river right just before Pembroke.&nbsp; There are plenty of campsites along this stretch of river.&nbsp; None of the rapids are more than a riffle or small wave train.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Pembroke to Pearisburg:</strong> There are two islands shortly below Pembroke; the second has superb campsites on both sides of the island, about halfway between the ends of the island.&nbsp; A couple miles below the island the river passes under a bridge for Route 460, and the wonderful scenery continues on the other side.&nbsp; There is one large wave train about three miles above Pearisburg, with waves that can be two to three feet high even at relatively low water.&nbsp; The rapid is not technical; just be ready to get wet.&nbsp; There is a big island just upstream of Pearisburg, the tip of which is visible from the takeout.&nbsp; Great fishing continues throughout this stretch; dedicated fishermen could easily spend two days going the 10 miles or so between Pembroke and Pearisburg.</span></p>",,1,1,0,20,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 17:57:44",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p class=""blog""><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>North River Campground to Stokesville:</strong> This five mile or so trip passes through a very scenic gorge with numerous rock cliffs and hemlock groves. After the put in there is an easy section flowing over a loose rock bottom, followed by small ledges interspersed with an occasional boulder garden and chute. You will notice a trail cross the creek several times, beginning with the gate at the put in. At the third crossing there are a couple of large rocks that tend to pick up strainers, followed by a hard right turn. For the first three miles or so there are no large drops, but in a few places it is necessary to proceed very cautiously because there are likely to be several river wide strainers that require a portage, some of which may be in fast moving water. After passing under a suspension footbridge, prepare for the hardest rapid of the trip, a double ledge near the Girl Scout camp. This double ledge consists of a slide that veers left into a cliff, then turns hard right before passing over another four foot sloping ledge. The first ledge often has wood on the left side of the rapid, where most of the water is going. It is not possible to see the end of this first slide until you are fairly close to committing, so I recommend approaching this rapid on river right, indicated by a horizon line and high cliff on the left. The second ledge is best run on river left at lower water levels, when the rest of it is very shallow. There is a decent recovery pool below this double ledge at lower water levels. This section of the North River </span><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">is runnable if the Stokesville gauge reads 100 cfs or greater. At 100 cfs, this is a class II+ run, but should not be undertaken by novices because of frequent strainers. At significantly higher water levels this run increases greatly in difficulty because pools wash out, waves become much larger, and it can be much harder to eddy out before strainers. </span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Stokesville to Natural Chimneys:</strong> Above the one lane Stokesville bridge and below the Little River confluence are several class 1 to 2 wave trains in beautiful National Forest.&nbsp; Below the Stokesville bridge the river braids and unbraids several time, and there are numerous strainers in all the channels around the islands.&nbsp; As of March 2008 I would not recommend running from Stokesville to Natural Chimneys.&nbsp; Note that Rt 758 crosses the river here at a ford, so do not attempt to drive across if there is enough water to canoe.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Natural Chimneys to Bridgewater:</strong> The river appears to become less strainer prone below Rt 731, but I’m not certain that it does.&nbsp; There is a 10 foot or so dam just upstream of the Rt 42 in Bridgewater, so taking out in the vicinity of Round Hill, perhaps on the west side of town, is recommended.</span></p>

Unfortunately, a large portion of the river is underwater in what is now Lake Anna.

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Hewlett Road to Route 1:</strong> This is one of the most outstanding stretches of river in the state.&nbsp; There are many little ledges and gravel bars with deep, beautiful holes that are just full of smallmouth, largemouth, and fallfish.&nbsp; Some of these suckers are big.&nbsp; This is worth fishing thoroughly, particularly the deep holes, which can produce several large fish apiece.&nbsp; This 9 miles is supremely lovely, with nice rocks and mature hardwood forest and absolutely no sprawl.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The North Fork of the Shenandoah runs from northwestern Rockingham County east to the flank of Massanutten, then north before turning east to join the South Fork of the Shenandoah in Front Royal.&nbsp; Although it runs alongside or through mountains or agricultural areas throughout, the river’s character changes dramatically from its source in the highlands to its terminus in Front Royal.&nbsp; Before it enters the Shenandoah Valley by slicing through North Mountain, the North Fork is a pebbly little mountain stream, surrounded by mountains, populated with trout, and characterized by good gradient and velocity, though without major rapids.&nbsp; After passing the Cootes Store gauge on the western edge of the Valley, the North Fork widens and slows down, and the mountain views become more distant as it passes through farmland and the towns of Broadway and Timberville on its way toward Massanutten.&nbsp; After passing through some hills near New Market Battlefield, the North Fork flows beneath I81 and shortly begins making very wide bends on the western edge of Massanutten, where the river’s gradient and velocity decrease further.&nbsp; The wide slow bends continue past Strasburg, where the river turns east and makes a bee line for its sister Fork in Front Royal.&nbsp; The scenery is good for the entirety of the river’s course, from little hollers in western Rockingham to views of Massanutten further downstream.&nbsp; There are no dams requiring a portage until the river passes near Edinburg.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Riverside Church: </strong>Follow Route 259 as far north as water levels will allow, potentially up to Bergton.&nbsp; At lower levels put in at Yankeetown Road, which is just a couple miles downstream of Riverside Church.&nbsp; Route 259 follows the river fairly closely so you will be able to judge where you can put it.&nbsp; You can park on the west side of the river at Yankeetown Road, but I’d recommend putting the boat in the water on the north side of the road, east side of the river.&nbsp; There is also parking at Riverside Church, the next road crossing upstream, up Rt 259.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Cootes Store:</strong> Park where Rt 259 crosses the North Fork, about a mile east of where the North Fork cuts between Little North Mountain and Great North Mountain, and just a few minutes west of Broadway along Rt 259/Lee Hwy.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Quicksburg Road/Rt 767:</strong> turn east on Rt 767 from Rt 11, using the Shenandoah Caverns/Rt 730 exit if coming from the north on I81 or the New Market/Rt 11 exit if coming from the south.&nbsp; Park on the north side of the road about 200 yards west of the river.&nbsp; This take out functions, but is less than ideal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Meems Bottom Bridge:</strong> Meems Bottom bridge (Route 720) has parking and a convenient put in for canoes.&nbsp; Although the map says that Route 730 has an official put in, Meems Bottom is a better put in.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Route 698/Red Bank Road:</strong> It is possible to put in along Rt 698 at a small gravel pull pull off north of Mount Jackson.&nbsp; Route 698 follows the river for several miles; look for the spot where the river is right next to the road and someone has placed “Do Not Litter” signs in both English and Spanish.&nbsp; Other unofficial put ins along Route 698 are posted.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Edinburg:</strong> There is no put in on Route 675, so use the put in at the confluence of Stony Creek and the North Fork.&nbsp; From Route I81: follow Route 675 east into Edinburg.&nbsp; Turn left on Route 11, then look for a tiny sign for Water Street on the right.&nbsp; If you miss Water Street you can turn right on South Hisey Street to get to Water Street.&nbsp; Follow Water Street across a low water bridge over Stony Creek, then park at the confluence, which is apparently a public take out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Burnshire Dam: </strong>Put in at Route 758 below the dam, and park in a little gravel pull out in VDOT right of way.&nbsp; The put in is on the west side of the river, downstream side of the bridge, down a small dirt path.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Route 661:</strong> Where Route 661 runs down to the river, there is a private bridge to the east side.&nbsp; There is no good way to put in or take out at this private bridge, short of carrying your boat up a small waterfall on a tributary just below the bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Deer Rapids Road: </strong>This low water bridge with roadside parking makes for an easy put in or take out, and is the preferred take out for the overnighter from Burnshire Dam to Deer Rapids Road.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Riverside Church/Yankeetown Road to Cootes Store:</strong> The North Fork flows nine miles south and then east, at a quick pace over numerous gravel bars interspersed with pools.&nbsp; Fishing is good in the pools despite the annual fish kills on the North and South Forks.&nbsp; Note the tumors on the fallfish.&nbsp; Mountains and fields surround the river.&nbsp; If you are putting in at Yankeetown Road in the evening there are a couple good campsites on river right after the river bends right away from the road about a mile downriver.&nbsp; Rapids are class 1 at low levels.&nbsp; There are no large rapids except perhaps resulting from very high water levels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Cootes Store to Route 767/Quicksburg Road:</strong> Although the North Fork runs close to several roads through this 15 mile or so stretch, it is a pretty stretch of river with good fishing, particularly where the banks are rocky.&nbsp; Camping opportunities are limited due to the proximity of roads and farms; I recommend consulting satellite photos and/or the Delorme Atlas Gazetteer if you plan on camping here so you can pinpoint a spot relatively far from roads.&nbsp; Negative aspects of this trip include some a smelly industrial facility in Broadway and some hideous sprawl on the west side of the river near New Market Battlefield.&nbsp; There is a nice cave just downstream of that sprawl on river left, about a mile or so upstream of Route 767.&nbsp; There is an old dam near Broadway and Timberville.&nbsp; Run it on the far right, where the drop is only about one and a half vertical feet, and the concrete is oriented in a curve that doesn’t create a hydraulic, then proceed down the channel on the right, which rejoins the main branch of the river some 100 yards downstream.&nbsp; Check for strainers here before running the drop.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Quicksburg to Meems Bottom Bridge:</strong> This is not a particularly notable stretch of river, and its scenic attributes are overshadowed by road noise from I81, at least when the trees are not foliated.&nbsp; Unless running this section as part of a longer trip from Cootes Store to Edinburg, I would recommend putting in at Meems Bottom rather than at Rt 767/Quicksburg.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Meems Bottom Bridge to Edinburg:</strong> Meems Bottom is a scenic floodplain with the old estate of Mt. Airy, tree lined roads, and the historic Meems Bottom covered bridge.&nbsp; The bridge, a wooden arch/truss combination, was built in 1892.&nbsp; It is an extraordinary span that is still open to traffic.&nbsp; A mile after Meems Bottom bridge the North Fork flows under Route 11 and the road noise from I81 disappears, even in spring before the trees have foliated.&nbsp; Pretty farms and views of Massanutten can be seen along the placid stretch of the North Fork between Meems Bottom and Edinburg.&nbsp; The rapids are all small, although there are a few ledges that merit caution not too far upstream of Edinburg.&nbsp; There are good campsites along the way, although many are fairly close to roads or homes.&nbsp; Although fish kills and factory farm pollution have wiped out most of the fish in the North Fork, it is still possible to catch medium size large and small mouths.&nbsp; Near Edinburg there are some of the best views in the area, as Massanutten looms over the North Fork.&nbsp; There are no hazards on this stretch of river.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Edinburg to Burnshire Dam (Route 758):</strong> There is a dam shortly downstream of Route 675, and immediately upstream of Route 758.&nbsp; It would be possible to put in at Route 672 and float to Route 670 for a roughly 7 or 8 mile day trip, but the dam below Edinburg and the Burnshire dam prevent longer trips through this section.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Burnshire Dam (Route 758) to Deer Rapids Road:</strong> This is a pretty 18 mile or so overnighter with great views of Massanutten.&nbsp; The current is fairly slow, although flat stretches are broken up with series of river wide ledges.&nbsp; There are some campsites along the way, although there are also plenty of homes visible from the river.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Deer Rapids Road to Strasburg:</strong> Neither Route 648 nor Route 55 are good take outs, so unless one is floating from Deer Rapids Road to the Route 612/Gafia Lodge or Bucks Mill/Route 610 take outs (an overnighter or long day trip), this stretch is not recommended.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Overview:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">The Potomac can be run clear from Harpers Ferry to just above Great Falls, and from just below Great Falls to Washington, DC. From the Blue Ridge through the Piedmont and over the Fall Line, the Potomac pours through stunning mountain passes, through mostly pristine Piedmont countryside, and through the deep and frightening Mather Gorge below Great Falls. From the Blue Ridge through the Piedmont the Potomac is perfect for camping and float fishing. The fall line section below Great Falls is hair raising. I acknowledge here that it is technically not a Virginia River.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Harpers Ferry:</strong> Put in alongside C&amp;O Canal on the north side of the river, west of where the railroads cross over Sandy Hook Road. There is a little pull-in (no parking permitted) where you can unload boats and carry over to the river, only a couple dozen yards downhill, just west of the intersection of Sandy Hook and Hoffmaster.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">After unloading the boats, drive back east and look for a parking spot in the gravel lots to the side of Sandy Hook.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Note that the parking will be filled up after mid morning from late spring through summer, so arrive early or leave your car elsewhere. Access Sandy Hook Road via Keep Tryst Road from Rt 340. Rt 340 does not intersect Sandy Hook directly. If you’re using this as a put in, I would recommend doing a bike shuttle using the C&amp;O Canal trail (use a hybrid or mountain bike), and leave your car at the bottom so you don’t have to worry about parking.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Sandy Hook:</strong> Park under the 340 bridge off the side of Sandy Hook Road. You can use this as a take out if you’re just playing around in the rapids from Harpers Ferry down to Rt 340. Parking is limited, though not as much as at Harpers Ferry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Rt 340:</strong> Across the river from the Sandy Hook take out, you can park just to the right off Rt 340 on the south side of the river. Parking is limited and the gate theoretically gets closed at dusk, though this has not been my experience. This takeout is fairly long and steep, but is clear.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Brunswick:</strong> The public put in is under the Rt 287 bridge. It is easy to miss this if you’re using it as a take out. From the river, you must cut through a little channel in the bank immediately after going under the bridge. This has plenty of parking.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Point of Rocks:</strong> There are public put-ins on both the north and south sides of the river of Rt 15; both have plenty of parking.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Nolans Ferry:</strong> From Maryland Rt 28, turn south on New Design Road and follow it until it dead ends. This is a good take out to use on an overnighter from Harpers Ferry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Algonkian Regional Park:</strong> Turn north on Cascades off of Algonkian Parkway, in the middle of the most horrific sprawl you will ever see unless you visit another park of eastern Loudoun.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Riverbend Park:</strong> turn north on Jeffrey off Riverbend Rd, which connects Beach Mill Rd and Georgetown Pike. If coming from the east take Georgetown Pike to Riverbend. If coming from the west turn left on Walker Rd in Great Falls, then right on Arnon Chapel, then left on Riverbend, then right on Jeffrey.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Great Falls National Park, Virginia Side:</strong> Located directly off Georgetown Pike Rt 193 not too far west of Difficult Run. Put in at “Fisherman’s Eddy,” located about 100 yards downstream of the visitors center. It costs $6 to enter the park.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Below Little Falls: </strong>There is a public put in along the canal where Reservoir Road intersects Canal Street, right along the river about ¾ mile downstream of Chain Bridge.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Harpers Ferry to Sandy Hook/Rt 340: </strong>This stretch of river has the largest rapids until Great Falls. There are regular riffles and waves, and a significant drop or wave train about 1/3 mile upriver of Rt 340. Run this last drop far left at low water or if you love wave trains. Open boats will probably take water, possibly enough to swamp at the right water levels if the boats don’t have much rocker. Run center or right for narrower drops with less volume, which might not be running at low levels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">For folks who haven’t visited Harpers Ferry, I recommend landing on a beach about 1/3 mile downstream of the put in and walking into town. The beach is on the west/south side of the river just about the railroad bridge, before the confluence with the Shenandoah. This stretch of river is one of the most beautiful in the state, with striking views of Maryland Heights, Loudoun Heights, Short Hill Mountain, and Harpers Ferry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Sandy Hook to Brunswick:</strong> Rapids are no more than little riffles for these few miles. To see a heron rookery paddle on the right side of the big island just downstream of Rt 340. The rookery is on the right side of the island. After passing this big island, you’ll see Short Hill Mountain on your right and South Mountain on your left (yes, to the north). The Appalachian Trail follows the South Mountain ridge. Stay to river right rounding the bend where the Potomac flows past Short Hill Mountain. About 1/3 mile after going past the tip of the ridge, go over two little drops and then pull over on river right; there is an old stone mill here. The path you see going uphill is the end of George’s Mill Road. From here it is about a 4 mile walk to the town of Lovettsville.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Below this old mill the river flattens out. Fish the big rocks in the middle of the river before cruising into Brunswick. Note that you have to cut through a narrow channel in the island on river left to get to the take out from the river. Brunswick has good eatin (Mommers Diner) and basic provisions (Jerry’s Liquor) within a 5 minute walk of the landing, if you need to stock up on the way downriver. Campsites on this stretch include the big island with the heron rookery, the old mill site, and spots along the C&amp;O canal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Brunswick to Point of Rocks: </strong>This is a flat stretch of river with pretty islands. One island about halfway through this stretch is on river left and has a fantastic campsite with a decent rope swing. There are several more outstanding campsites on subsequent islands, including one about 10 yards upstream of the Rt 15 bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Point of Rocks to Nolands Ferry:</strong> Heaters Island, which starts just downstream of the Rt 15 bridge, stretches about a third of this 4 mile stretch. There are some smaller islands near Nolands Ferry; if you want to take out here, stay to the left side of the river after Heaters Island.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Nolands Ferry to Algonkian Regional Park:</strong> The relatively flat, medium velocity river continues past a few large island and a bit of Loudoun sprawl.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Algonkian to River Bend:</strong> This stretch of river is very pretty after you get past the garish golf course community (Lowes Island) that the Loudoun Board of Supervisors approved. After you get past the golf course shit you’ll go through the Seneca Breaks, numerous islands and little riffles that lead all the way to Riverbend Park. Riverbend is not too easy to miss; the river narrows there, so you won’t miss it by being on the wrong side of an island. Do not under any conditions proceed beyond Riverbend, as you risk going over a small dam and then Great Falls.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Great Falls National Park (Virginia side) to below Chain Bridge:</strong> The Potomac passes through a highly landscape from Great Falls to its tidal reaches in Washington, D.C., and paddlers should plan trips based on water levels.&nbsp; Above 3.5 feet, Mather Gorge (the first couple miles below Fisherman’s Eddy put in on the Virginia side in Great Falls National Park) is a turbulent and difficult run, particularly for open boats or kayakers who don’t have a solid roll.&nbsp; At lower levels the large waves and holes disappear and it is suitable for novice paddlers. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Between Great Falls and its tidal reaches near Fletchers Boathouse, the Potomac passes through three distinct sections of river: Mather Gorge, the islands and riffles between Mather Gorge and Brookmont dam, and Little Falls.&nbsp; Mather Gorge has stunning scenery with sheer cliff walls, and should be visited by any resident of the D.C. region or Virginia, but non-advanced paddlers should not paddle it above levels of 3.5 feet.&nbsp; Between Mather Gorge and Brookmont dam the rapids are easy boulder gardens and riffles, perhaps reaching Class I+ in difficulty.&nbsp; An outstanding day trip is to float from the top of Mather Gorge at Fisherman’s eddy down to Lock 10, as this will permit the paddler to see the whole gorge section of the Potomac. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">It is illegal and dangerous to run Brookmont dam, so don’t.&nbsp; Below Brookmont, the river concentrates on river right, passing through first a Class I boulder garden right below the dam, then some Class I wave trains, and then Little Falls.&nbsp; Little Falls is complex, potentially dangerous, and changes dramatically with water level, so I highly recommend going with someone who knows the lines.&nbsp; The easiest line, at least at water levels in the 3-5 foot range, is to start in the center of the left (main) flow, cut left behind a hole at top left, then run down the wave train to the bottom.&nbsp; This route avoids the pinning rocks, waves and holes that choke the river right routes.&nbsp; Another fairly safe option for levels at perhaps 3.5-4 feet is to start far left, slide over a fairly shallow slide for the first drop, eddy out, then ferry out working hard left below and through the second drop.&nbsp; Another option is to start in the main (left channel) flow and work right, eddying out to river right of Cleaver rock, which is part of a large and nasty rock formation in the middle of the lower section of Little Falls.&nbsp; It certainly looks like paddlers could get terminally pinned in this formation, and many canoes have wrapped on Cleaver.&nbsp; Below the falls there is a rectangular concrete formation on the left.&nbsp; You can carry your boat up here and walk some 200 yards to the canal, then paddle another couple hundred yards up the canal to Lock 5.&nbsp; Or you can continue downstream to Fletchers Boathouse.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Due to the hassle of portaging Brookmont dam, I would suggest planning trips that avoid it, which is possible using multiple river access points on the Maryland side of the river in the C&amp;O Canal National Historic Park.&nbsp; For example, a good daytrip is Fisherman’s Eddy (Virginia side) to Lock 10 (Maryland side), or put in at Old Anglers, paddle all the way up Mather Gorge, then run down to Lock 10 to avoid the hassle of driving back and forth across the river.&nbsp; Locks 6 and 5 provide good access to Little Falls—it is fairly easy for kayakers to park at Lock 6 and run Little Falls, take out and walk/paddle back.&nbsp; For additional details on this complex and beautiful section of river see American Whitewater’s website, which has details about different water levels, play holes, and river access points.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Overview:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Potts Creek is one of the most unusual creeks in Virginia. It has springs which boil out into the creek, a section where the river runs underground, occasional precipitous ledges, and unbelievably high cliffs. Sadly, it also has quite a few hovels and rural detritus along its banks, though its scenic attributes more than make up for the occasional garbage. Potts Creek holds water longer than nearby Wilson or Dunlap Creeks, and seems runnable generally at least 48 hours after a good rain, and generally is runnable during winter or spring except in a dry spell.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Covington:</strong> Potts Creek joins the Jackson at the southern edge of Covington, but the creek has a dangerous dam with extremely inconvenient portages shortly above the confluence, so the superior take out is the second Route 18 bridge south of Covington (the first one is next to the dam, which is visible from the road). This informal takeout has a gravel lot on river left but no boat ramp. This bridge is 2.5 miles or so south of the city line.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Bridge Gauge:</strong> The fourth Route 18 bridge south of Covington has a USGS steel tubular gauge next to it and very limited roadside parking. Unlike many other Route 18 bridges, it is pretty convenient to take out here and adjacent private land is not posted.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>The Sinks:</strong> The sixth Route 18 bridge south of Covington is above the geologically notable sinks, where Potts Creek goes underground. There is a stub road on the south side of the river here with access to the creek, though it would be advisable to knock on the door of the beautiful white house with two two-story porches since the old road is essentially his front yard. This put in is right across the river from the Rt 613 junction with Rt 18.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Boiling Springs:</strong> The eighth Route 18 bridge south of Covington is shortly upstream of Boiling Spring, a powerful spring which surges up into Potts Creek. Access to the river can be obtained by asking landowners for permission. Note: for bridges further upstream/farther from Covington, see Ed Grove/Roger Corbett.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to run:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Boiling Springs to the Sinks: </span></strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Boiling Springs is visible on the left side of the river shortly downstream of the put in. Water surges from the creek substrate up into the creek and creates bubbles of a foot or more in diameter which come far above the water's surface. The creek makes two fairly tight bends through class I rapids with nice mountain scenery before the Rt 18 bridge above the Sinks becomes visible. Above this bridge is a class I-II rapid depending on one's route. On the right side one will approach a horizon line, then drop over a fairly shallow sloping ledge into a hole. This side appears too shallow at medium to lower runnable levels. When the right side has insufficient water or an easier route is preferred, river left is an easy class I shoal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The Sinks to the bridge gauge: </span></strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Below the Sinks put in and the attractive ledge one will see a large, attractive white house on the right. It has elegant two story porches and an unusual modernist addition on its west side, which is a square three story box with a translucent facade. The whole building is twisted. Apparently this landowner does not appreciate visitors, although I have not encountered him when I have paddled through here. Below this two-house set near the bridge is the first ledge above the Sinks, a straightforward two foot drop. Below that ledge is an old mill on the left, which is located at a larger four foot high vertical ledge. This ledge could create dangerous hydraulics at higher water levels. At low to medium levels, I recommend running off one of the tongues that protrude and allow the paddler to shoot clear of some slightly indented hydraulics. Though the concave parts of the ledge have more water they are more likely to result in swamping or getting stuck in a hole. There is a nice prow with water on it on river left, which allows the paddler to get out of the water in an eddy in case of a mishap. Immediately downstream of this ledge is a class II ledge/slide with small boulders and, on either side, very large, very old mill equipment or trees in the water. It would not be safe to be swimming near the shore above either of these features. Below this ledge/slide and the old mill, a large concrete abutment is visible on the left. Stay on river left, as 80% of the volume of Potts Creek enters a cave on the right. Paddlers entering this cave are unlikely to see daylight again, as the ceiling is too low to permit passage and the channel is choked with boulders and strainers. Instead, portage the ledge on the left. Or, at medium to higher levels, run it on the right. The left side of the ledge (which is approximately 5 feet high) is very shallow and will result in pitons, broken boats, and swimmers. The right side also has a high probability of pitons but at least one has a slim chance of running it cleanly, particularly in more rockered boats. Below this ledge is another short slide, then a large pool with cliffs on either side and a cave on the left. Near the end of the pool Potts Creek emerges from its cave. I doubt any human has navigated the entire cave except in drought conditions. Below this remarkable series of ledges, slides, mills, modernist architecture, and underground rivers, the paddler will float through miles of class I whitewater alternating between scenery that alternates between the tawdry and sublime. Potts Creek passes by small collections of hovels with picnic shelters, chained dogs, and oxidizing automobiles, then darts away from human habitation before flowing beneath hundred foot high cliffs. As depressing as the trash and settlements are, the extraordinary shale cliffs, hemlock stands, cedar forests, and general wildness of the river is overwhelming. One has the feeling of discovering a river with wonders which the Hudson River school painters would have documented if they'd known about it. The next take out, at the gauging station, is evident by the gauge on the left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Bridge Gauge to Covington:</span> </strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Do not take out at the bridge gauge because the subsequent few miles have unbelievable scenery and cliffs as high as those along the lower Cowpasture or New River. Potts Creek doesn't change much in size but passes by cliffs that increase in height, with the most impressive being at least 300-400 feet high with extraordinary pines growing on a few limited shelves. Be sure to remember the last bridge, as your car will not be visible unless you park in the part of the gravel lot closest to the water.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Overview:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Dunlap Creek drains one of the highest, most rugged regions of Virginia in the western headwaters of the James River, yet it is not a particularly remote watershed. Its valley, along Route 159, is not far from the Covington, so paddlers on the Dunlap will encounter an unusual mix of gorgeous turquoise water, abundant wildlife, interminable forested mountains, and extensive redneck habitation. The Dunlap grows quickly from a small stream in the vicinity of Crows, at the Route 311 junction, to its confluence with the Jackson some 20 miles downstream. It is a worthy trip for paddlers who have visited the upper Jackson, Back Creek, Bullpasture, Cowpasture, and other regional attractions. Dunlap Creek does not hold water particularly long, and probably should be run within 36 hours of rain or during a period of snowmelt.</span></p>

(Note that paddling to this takeout commits one to portaging a large dam; see below)</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Crows to Callaghan/I-64:</strong> For 14 miles Dunlap Creek meanders through a widening valley over small ledges, riffles, and boulder gardens, none of which exceed technical Class I rapids. The only hazards are a couple of wires strung across the river and strainers, which are most frequently located in the braided, pebbly sections of river where unstable stream banks topple trees across the river. Also be on watch for strainers that are prone to accumulate against private bridge abutments. Riverbed morphology varies considerably, ranging from solid bedrock, generally shale, to well rounded pebbles. There are a few sections of sizable boulders but for the most part the stream is unobstructed except by many small and some large islands. River velocity is high when the creek is runnable, averaging some three miles per hour or more. The water is transparent and turquoise, complementing the innumerable arbor vitae and white cedar trees that are more prevalent in this region than any other in Virginia. Though this section of river has dozens of modest country houses along it and dozens of fords and pedestrian suspension bridges, there is abundant wildlife and the water quality appears to be quite good. In one day we encountered a bald eagle, 10 pileated woodpeckers, two dozen wood ducks and buffleheads, several herons and kingfishers, at least a dozen bluebirds, many songbirds and a beaver. The streams wide bends across the valley create a pleasant diversity of streambank habitat, which range from open mature deciduous woodlands to sycamore-dominated floodplains to hemlock and fern-carpeted north-facing hillsides.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Callaghan/I-64 to Humpback Bridge:</span> </strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">This section is only a couple miles but is substantially different in character from the 14 miles upstream. It begins with easy boulder gardens, then passes through a long series of Class I-II ledges with rocky islands and midstream trees. There are very attractive views of the mountain to the north. After passing under the first Route 60 bridge one will see a concrete abutment on the right which signals a potentially dangerous 5-6 foot high dam. Be aware that there is no slackwater backed up by the dam, which makes it more dangerous. It is possible to take out on the grass on the right and portage, though getting back down to the water is inconvenient. River left portages are possible too, though at higher water one would risk getting swept over the far left portion of the dam which presents a nice landing spot at lower runnable levels. At lower levels the center slot is runnable, though lightly-rockered boats will bust bow and stern and a hole at the terminus of the drop could swamp or flip less experienced paddlers. On either side of this center slot are potentially terminable hydraulics. At higher runnable levels this center slot probably isn't runnable safely, as the hole at the bottom of it could feed the hydraulics on either side. Humpback bridge, built around the time of the Civil War, is shortly downstream of the dam. It is an attractive arched covered bridge whose design is unique in Virginia. Nor have I seen covered bridges of its kind in Ohio or Indiana, where covered bridges are more common. Its craftsmen used elegant mortise and tenon attachments to build the arching trusses, and the cedar shakes covering it add to its beauty.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The Nottoway has a vast watershed, draining much of southside.&nbsp; It has one of the more abrupt fall lines in the state, where the river pours over several large sloping falls in rapid succession.&nbsp; Below the falls it runs south past Courtland before joining the Blackwater and continuing into North Carolina.&nbsp; Although it is not as swampy for as great a percentage of its length as the Blackwater, it has impressive cypress groves near Courtland, despite continuing and intense logging that in some cases extends up to the riverbank.&nbsp; Because the Nottoway has more volume than the adjacent Blackwater, it has a defined channel that is separated from the swampy backwater by a berm of built-up sediments.&nbsp; The best views on the Nottoway come from walking around the backwater areas, so be sure to plan short days that allow for plenty of swamp exploration.&nbsp; In drier conditions it is possible to walk around much of the swamp, but if you visit after snowmelt or rain bring waders if you plan on traversing the swamp.&nbsp; The Nottoway has the highest concentration of hunting activity I’ve seen in Virginia, so wear ample blaze orange at all times during the season.</span></p>

<p><strong>Graves Mill:</strong> Follow Graves Mill Road upriver as far as the water level will allow.&nbsp; General Banks Ln, a little road to the right off Graves Mill Rd, has a good unofficial put in next to the one lane bridge about a mile downstream of Graves Mill.</p>
<p><strong>Graves Mill Road:</strong> About 5 or 6 miles downstream of Graves Mill, the Rapidan goes under Graves Mill Road.&nbsp; There is a good put in on the west bank just after the road crosses the river.</p>
<p><strong>Route 230/Wolftown Road:</strong> A few miles downstream of the Graves Mill Road crossing of the Rapidan, and perhaps midway between Standardsville and Rt 29.</p>
<p><strong>Route 29:</strong> From the northbound lanes, take a small, steep gravel lane on the south bank of the river to a decent unofficial put in.&nbsp; A non-4 wheel drive car might have some trouble here.</p>
<p><strong>Route 231:</strong> About 12 miles downstream of 29.&nbsp; Park on the south bank of the river, west side of the road; use the small grassy path to access the river.&nbsp; This is a decent unofficial take out.&nbsp; Access via 29 to the north or 20/33 to the south.</p>
<p><strong>Madison Mills:</strong> This put in is located very close to the Rt 15 bridge; just north of the bridge, turn west on Madison Mills Road and follow it approximately 1/10th of a mile to a dead end.&nbsp; The small dirt path leads some 25 feet down to the river.</p>
<p><strong>Rt 522:</strong> Drive down a gravel road on the south side of the river, east side of the road, to an unofficial public put in immediately adjacent to Route 522.</p>
<p><strong>Germanna:</strong> There is a public canoe put in where Route 3 crosses the Rapidan.</p>
<p><strong>Ely’s Ford Road/Rt610:</strong> Access via Rt 3 to south, or Kellys Ford/Edwards Shop/Fields Mill Roads to the north.&nbsp; This put in has a canoe ramp that won’t work for motor boats.</p>
<p><strong>Sections of River to Run:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Graves Mill to Wolftown Road (about 6 miles): </strong>The Rapidan is a tiny little mountain creek with a pebbly bottom, no difficult rapids, and fantastic views.&nbsp; The surrounding farmland is quite pretty, though they need to plant some more riparian buffers.&nbsp; In high water be very wary of strainers, which are not infrequent.&nbsp; There is also a low water bridge a mile or so downstream of General Banks Lane bridge.&nbsp; The Rapidan gets a considerable infusion of water from Garth Run, which enters shortly after Graves Mill Road bridge.&nbsp; Therefore, if it is too shallow above the Graves Mill Road bridge, put in at the bridge; there will be enough water in about 150 yards, after Garth Run comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Wolftown Road to Route 29 (about 12 miles):</strong> Below Wolftown Road the Rapidan widens slightly, so you’re not running into the bank every 10 feet.&nbsp; It is still very pretty, although there are occasional sections with eroded banks due to deforestation.&nbsp; Also, be very careful about fences.&nbsp; Someone has hung a very dangerous fence from the 230 bridge.&nbsp; There is another fence across the river about 0.5 miles downstream of the Wolftown bridge.&nbsp; It is electrical; be careful.&nbsp; Then there is another fence perhaps 4 miles below that.&nbsp; None of them are too hard to portage at reasonable water levels.</p>
<p><strong>Route 29 to Route 231 (about 12 miles):</strong> Although pretty, this part of the river has higher banks and is less scenic than sections either upstream or near the confluence with the Rappahannock.&nbsp; There would be plenty of camping opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Route 231 to Route 15:</strong> The Rapidan is slow, flat, and scenic during this winding 10 mile trip from Madison Mills to Liberty Mills.&nbsp; A four foot high, potentially hazardous dam is located approximately 7 miles into the trip; it backs up a mile or so of slackwater.&nbsp; The dam can be run through the left slot at the right water levels, or portaged on the right.&nbsp; In high water, take care not to run either the right slot or across the middle.&nbsp; &nbsp;The right slot has a shallow landing and the middle has many potential pinning rocks.&nbsp; At low water, the dam can also be portaged by taking out in the middle of the dam and carrying across the rocks below.&nbsp; With roads and houses almost entirely absent from this trip, this makes for a very pretty float trip.&nbsp; This section has enough water at approximately 1.5 feet on the Culpeper gauge on the Rapidan.</p>
<p><strong>Route 15 to Route 522:</strong> 14.5 miles</p>
<p><strong>Route 522 to Germanna:</strong> For the first half of this trip, the Rapidan is very shallow and sandy.&nbsp; Then it becomes much rockier, and appears very similar to the Rappahannock near the confluence.&nbsp; This stretch of river is pretty and remote, and the rockier, ledgier parts have good fishing.&nbsp; There is plenty of camping, including on numerous sandy islands.&nbsp; There is a particularly pretty island to camp on where sand has deposited between large rocks in the river just a couple miles upstream of Germanna.&nbsp; This is about a 13 mile run, and has enough water at roughly 1.5 feet on the Culpeper gauge.</p>
<p><strong>Germanna to Ely’s Ford:</strong> The river continues to flow over and around pretty rocks, with interspersed sections of sand.&nbsp; Fishing is good and scenery is quite pretty.&nbsp; This is a 8 mile long stretch of river, a good day trip.</p>
<p><strong>Ely’s Ford Road to Motts Run Landing:</strong> This run includes about 9 miles of the Rapidan, then another 8 miles or so of the Rappahannock.&nbsp; This is a very pretty run, with nice forested hillsides and rocky river, particularly near and at the confluence.&nbsp; A great campsite is at the confluence, in the middle of the two rivers.&nbsp; Other campsites are just downstream, on the Rappahannock, on river right, near the old stone wall.&nbsp; This stretch requires a little more water to run comfortably, at least 1.6 feet on the Culpeper gauge.&nbsp; Lower water runs will require walking through the confluence area, which can become very shallow.</p>

<p>The Rappahanock is the longest undammed river in the Commonwealth, thanks to Senator Warner, who removed the Embrey dam near Fredericksburg in the late 1990s.&nbsp; Although development has marred much of the lower Rappahannock, above the fall line the river is in great shape, largely because the City of Fredericksburg owns a good deal of land along its banks, which it preserves to maintain the quality of the city’s drinking water.&nbsp; You can put in at least as far upriver as Crest Hill Road in northern Fauquier/Rappahannock Counties.&nbsp; Rapids are small until about 3 miles downriver of Remington, as the river cuts through the Piedmont with relatively little elevation change.&nbsp; From below Remington through Fredericksburg the gradient is higher and the rapids are a little larger, particularly 3 miles below Remington, at the confluence with the Rapidan, and at the fall line.&nbsp; The Rappahannock is at its most scenic from the first significant rapids below Remington to Motts Landing, which is just a few miles from Fredericksburg.&nbsp; The paucity of road crossings is a blessing, as it minimizes the surrounding sprawl and keeps the river from getting too crowded.&nbsp; Fishing is great, particularly smallmouth and fallfish.&nbsp; The short run from Motts Landing to the park in Fredericksburg is a good short day trip, and has the largest rapids on the trip, although compared to the Potomac or James these fall line rapids are quite easy.</p>

<p><strong>Crest Hill Road:</strong> From the east, on I66 take the westernmost exit for Marshall, turning south from exit ramp onto Free State Road.&nbsp; Immediately take a right, going west, onto Crest Hill Rd.&nbsp; Follow Crest Hill for about 25 minutes to the bridge over the Rappahannock From the west take Crest Hill west off of 522 in Flint Hill.&nbsp; The Rappahannock is just a few minutes out of town.</p>
<p><strong>Tapps Ford Road:</strong> Access via Crest Hill to north and Rt 211 to south.&nbsp; Put in is on north side of river, on the east side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>Remington:</strong> Put in on Business 29, unloading canoe on north side of river.&nbsp; Then park in town of Remington, at commuter lot near the bank, which is a block to the northeast of the main intersection, near the railroad tracks.&nbsp; Do not park along the road south of the river; an unruly owner lives there and will try to get your car towed.&nbsp; He egged my car.&nbsp; Fortunately the police in Culpeper are very understanding and do not tow reflexively.</p>
<p><strong>Kellys Ford:</strong> This is located off Summerduck Road to the north and Kellys Ford/Edwards Shop Road to the south.</p>
<p><strong>Motts Landing:</strong> From I95, take Rt 3 west, go about a mile through some sprawl, turn right on Bragg Rd, then go about a half mile and turn left on River Road, then proceed a couple miles west.&nbsp; The public boat landing is on your right at the bottom of a hill.</p>
<p><strong>Fredericksburg:</strong> There is a park downriver of the Rt 17 Business bridge that goes through downtown Fredericksburg.&nbsp; It isn’t designed as a takeout, but can be used as one.&nbsp; It is located off Sophia St in the city.&nbsp; Use Fall Hill Avenue for the Motts Run/Fredericksburg trip.</p>
<p><strong>Sections of River to Run:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crest Hill Road to Tapps Ford:</strong> I haven’t run this section.</p>
<p><strong>Tapps Ford Road to Route 211:</strong> This is a pretty 8 mile or so stretch of river, with nice rocks, riffles, and farmland, and no major rapids. There are plenty of campsites.&nbsp; if you are putting in at night at Tapps Ford, proceed ½ mile and camp on river left, after getting past an ugly subdivision on the south bank.</p>
<p><strong>Route 211 to Remington:</strong> This 25 mile or so stretch is a leisurely flatwater stretch with fields all around and relatively high banks.&nbsp; The fishing probably isn’t too good.&nbsp; The Hazel River, which appears to be bigger than the Rappahanock, joins it just a few miles above Remington.</p>
<p><strong>Remington to Kellys Ford:</strong> This is about 4 miles, the first 3 of which are unremarkable.&nbsp; The last mile, however, is beautiful and fun, with many rock gardens.&nbsp; There are fish, even in the sandy bottom stretch. &nbsp;The last mile is class 1-2 whitewater.&nbsp; Tie in your gear if you’re camping.</p>
<p><strong>Kellys Ford to Motts Run Landing:</strong> This is a remarkable 24 mile long stretch of river without a single road crossing or public put in.&nbsp; The scenery is outstanding, as is the fishing.&nbsp; There are plenty of camping opportunities, including at a lovely site located at the confluence of the Rappahanock and Rapidan, about 2/3 of the way through the trip.&nbsp; The only significant rapids are those at the confluence, which are class 1 and 2 ledges and boulder gardens.&nbsp; Be sure to look back at the confluence as you’re navigating the rapids.&nbsp; It sure is pretty.&nbsp; This is the best overnighter in central/northern Virginia in the summer, when smaller rivers are too low.</p>
<p><strong>Motts Run Landing to Fredericksburg:</strong> This is a class 2 run with some challenging drops.&nbsp; It resembles the James at the fall line, but not as difficult, with beautiful islands and river grasses.&nbsp; The scenery is surprisingly good considering the nearby sprawl in Spotsylvania.&nbsp; You’ll go under I95 and Rt 17 business before taking out on the left at a park, where the river bottom turns very sandy.&nbsp; This trip has a wide variety of rock formations.&nbsp; Be sure to say a prayer of thanks for the removal of Embrey Dam, which used to back up the river under I95.</p>

<p>The north and south forks of the Rivanna join to form a reservoir just north of Charlottesville.&nbsp; The river then flows along the east side of the city through Woolen Mills.&nbsp; You can paddle from Darden Towe Park to Columbia, where the Rivanna joins the James, in about 2 long days.&nbsp; The rapids are no bigger than class two, and the river is surprisingly remote and pretty considering its proximity to Charlottesville and Fluvanna County’s irresponsible land use policies.&nbsp; The water is generally very clear, and there are all kind of pretty fish, rocks, and underwater grasses just below the surface.&nbsp; Kingfishers will accompany you the entire way.&nbsp; You can camp most anywhere; there aren’t too many 'No Trespassing' signs along the way.&nbsp; The only downside of the trip is some sewage pollution coming from Lake Monticello, which one can smell at the discharge point and for a short distance downstream.&nbsp; The Rivanna is a great float trip, particularly during the spring and summer when the canopy shades much of the river.&nbsp; There is generally enough water into early/mid summer, and perhaps beyond depending on rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Trips:</strong></p>
<span class=""blog"" face=""verdana, geneva"" size=""3"">
<ul>
<li>(overnighter) Put in at Darden Towe Park, float all day, camp either just upstream or downstream of Palmyra, and float to Columbia the next day.&nbsp; About 34 miles.&nbsp; Looking at a map you’d never think you could go this far easily in 2 days, but the velocity of the Rivanna is surprisingly high considering there are no major rapids on it; I’ve canoed from Market St to well past Palmyra in a day (leisurely).&nbsp; It isn’t uncommon to go 3 mph on this river.</li>
<li>(daytrip) Put in at Market Street and float to the Rt 600 (Crofton) takeout. 13 mi.</li>
<li>(daytrip) Put in at Milton and take out at Palmyra.&nbsp; 15 mi.</li>

<p><strong>Darden Towne park</strong> located off Route 20 just north of Route 250.&nbsp; This is usually a more convenient location in regards to a shuttle than the Market St put-in.</p>
<p><strong>Market St</strong> takeout is located on the west/south side of the river near the old Woolen Mills in the City of Charlottesville.&nbsp; There is very limited parking. &nbsp;To get there take E. Market Street out of downtown until its eastern terminus, which is in an old residential neighborhood.&nbsp; You’ll have to carry your boat a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Milton</strong> takeout is located on the north side of the river.&nbsp; To get there turn south on Milton Road from Rt 250, just east of where Rt 22 intersects with 250.&nbsp; From Milton Rd turn left/east onto a tiny dirt road, which leads down to a little put in.</p>
<p><strong>Crofton</strong> takeout is located at the river crossing of Rt 600, South Boston Rd, which connects Rt 616 Union Mills Road with Rt 53.&nbsp; This is a good takeout with plenty of parking.</p>
<p><strong>Palmyra</strong> takeout is located on the south side of the river where Rt 15 crosses it, near a couple of general stores and a restaurant in the village of Palmyra.</p>
<p><strong>Columbia</strong> takeout is located on the James River about 100 yards downstream of where the Rivanna joins the Columbia, off Columbia Rd which intersects Rt 6 in the tiny town of Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>Sections of River to Run:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Darden Towe Park to Milton:</strong> This is about 5 miles.&nbsp; Shortly after putting in you’ll go under I64.&nbsp; There are plenty of campsites in here and nice scenery.&nbsp; The first bridge you come to is Milton.&nbsp; This run would only take about 1.5 or 2 hours. This section has the highest gradient and the most rapids, which generally are I-II with some solid IIs around 900cfs.</p>
<p><strong>Milton to Crofton:</strong> This is a 9 mile stretch, which takes a half day at normal water levels.&nbsp; It is quite pretty mostly, with the exception of some McMansions on the left bank shortly after the put in and a few Lake Monticello homes near the take out.&nbsp; Mostly it is all wooded and narrow with plenty of wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>Crofton to Palmyra:</strong> This is about 6 miles, only takes 2.5 or 3 hours.&nbsp; There are no bridges on this section other than the put in/take out.&nbsp; This section is quite pretty and remote with great campsites.&nbsp; Palmyra is quite pretty with the old Rt 15 bridge (which is being replaced) and the remnants of a bridge abutment in the middle of the river. There is a class II rapid in this section you may want to scout.</p>
<p><strong>Palmyra to Columbia:</strong> This is a day trip or half of an overnighter.&nbsp; There is a little bridge (Cariesbrook Rd, which runs east from Rt 15) that could be an unofficial takeout, but it isn’t recommended because the land is posted and there is nowhere to park except by the side of the road, where you can be towed in 24 hours.&nbsp; Shortly before you reach the confluence with the James you’ll go under a pretty truss bridge, which is Rt 6.&nbsp; This is a very nice stretch of river, just beautiful, without much development.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">The Robinson begins as a scenic mountain creek formed by Whiteoak Run and Cedar Run in Shenandoah National Park, and grows much larger with the addition of the Rose River just east of the Park. It flows through Madison County before joining the Rapidan near Orange, just a few miles west of Route 15. The Robinson emerges from one of the most scenic valleys in the foothills of the Blue Ridge, and passes through some of Virginia’s prettiest farmland.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 29:</strong> There is a high quality put in along VDOT right of way on River Road/Rt 636, which heads west from Rt 29 immediately on the south side of the river. Follow Rt 636 west from Rt 29 for a couple hundred yards; there is a small parking area before Rt 636 turns south up a hill.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Lillards Ford/Rt 607:</strong> Lillards Ford connects Rt 634/Oak Park Rd and Route 29 north of the town of Madison.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Route 15:</strong> Park on the west side of the road, north side of the river; the Rt 15 crossing of the Robinson is only a mile or so south of the Culpeper/Madison county line. One can take out under the bridge and carry up on the west side of the road, north side of the river. Except for a 10 foot section of large rock ballast, this is a decent unofficial put in. Be sure to leave a visible note saying that one is canoeing.&nbsp; Or, for easier access put in and park alongside Rt 721, a small gravel road that intersects the Robinson just north of Rt 15.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Banco to Rt 29:</strong> This is a pretty 5 mile trip that requires wet spring conditions or a good rain to run. Shortly after the put in there is a series of class 2 ledges. Take care to avoid the concrete lip on river left, which appears to have been installed to prevent the Robinson from washing Rt 609 away. After these ledges the Robinson loses gradient, and except for regular gravel bars does not have any rapids of note. This trip takes less than three hours at all but the lowest water conditions, and is a good choice in combination with other nearby streams during wet conditions. 6 feet is a reasonable minimum on the Locust Dale gauge of the Robinson, or perhaps 300 cfs.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Rt 29 to Rt 607/Lillards Ford:</strong> For the first few miles of this trip there are surprisingly high banks, perhaps because of a defunct dam. From the river you will see an old dam house from a hundred yards away or more, from which point it is not obvious if there is passage through the dam. Only when you are about 50 feet from the dam does it become clear that the far right portion of the dam was removed, and that there is fairly safe passage on river right. Be aware that at higher water levels the dam will probably back up some water, creating potentially turbulent conditions around and downstream of the dam. Immediately following the dam is a small rock garden, so at medium to higher water levels expect a class 2 rapid immediately after the dam. After the dam the banks and riparian buffers appear much healthier, and scenery generally improves. It only takes a couple hours to canoe from Rt 29 to Lillards Ford. 100 cfs is the bare minimum water level for this and the next section of the Robinson.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""><strong>Rt 607/Lillards Ford to Rt 15:</strong> There is no longer a ford at Lillards Ford, but instead a low water bridge. At low water levels (around 100 cfs), it is possible to canoe under this bridge, but higher water levels would require a portage. The good scenery continues for most of this part of the river, which takes three hours or so to paddle at a moderate pace. There are not hazards on this stretch of river except for a possible strainer</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">Rt 15 to Rapidan:</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"">For the first few miles the Robinson follows Rt 721, a small gravel road with little traffic.&nbsp; This section of river is attractive, with riffles, islands, and wildlife.&nbsp; Approximately halfway to the town of Rapidan the Robinson passes under Route 614, and a couple miles later joins the Rapidan at a remote and attractive confluence.&nbsp; The Rapidan will flatten out and become sluggish in the vicinity of a rail bridge near the town of Rapidan.&nbsp; Look for the takeout along the bank on river right above the dam and old mill.&nbsp; Not that this is a not a great takeout, with inconvenient access and parking.</span></p>",,1,1,0,33,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 19:42:40",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

<p>The North and South Forks of the Rockfish join near Route 6 in Nelson County about a mile or so east of Route 151.&nbsp; From the confluence the Rockfish flows southeast through several ridges to join the James at Howardsville, on the border of Nelson and Albemarle Counties.&nbsp; Considering the surrounding topography, the Rockfish is a fairly peaceful river, no more than class 2 before Schuyler.&nbsp; The scenery is pretty, particularly because the Rockfish is tiny; travelers will have intimate views of all the grasses, flowers and trees along the way.&nbsp; Some portions of the Rockfish are quite remote while others are alongside small roads.&nbsp; There is no sprawl to speak of.&nbsp; This is a nice trip that is convenient for folks near Charlottesville.</p>

<p><strong>Confluence:</strong> The best option is to put in on the North Fork where Rt 6 crosses it, about a mile east of the Rt 6/Rt 151 intersection. If there isn’t enough water there you could try to put in slightly further east, where Rt 6 parallels the river right near the confluence.</p>
<p><strong>Route 29: </strong>There is a high quality official put in on the north side of the river, east side of the road where 29 crosses the Rockfish, at the hamlet of Woods Mill.</p>
<p><strong>Rockfish River Road/Rt 617 &nbsp;above Schuyler:</strong> Rockfish River Road parallels the river for a long way, at some points closer to and at some points farther from the river. There is a decent unofficial put in between the Laurel Road bridge (the narrow older bridge at the eastern end of the section of Rockfish River Road that runs right alongside the river) and Schuyler. Coming from Schuyler, you’ll leave the river, go over a forested ridge, then come back down the ridge. After passing a home or two on your left there’s a field on the left, where the river is visible from the road. This can serve as a take out. Shortly thereafter the road leaves the river before rejoining it at the Laurel crossing.</p>
<p><strong>Schuyler:</strong> Follow Rockfish River Road/Rt 617 east out of Schuyler; there are a few good unofficial put ins just a couple hundred yards east of the Rt 800/Rt 617 intersection.<br />Howardsville: Take out at the public boat landing on the James, just downstream of the Rockfish/James confluence.</p>
<p><strong>Sections of River to Run:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confluence to Rt 29:</strong> The Rockfish is tiny up here, particularly near the confluence. It parallels Rt 6, but is not very close to it for most of the way. This trip takes a few hours at middling water levels. If you like little jungly rivers with hills this is a nice stretch. Rapids are small.</p>
<p><strong>Rt 29 to Schuyler:</strong> The river widens to about Tye width, has a few little ledges and one small, decrepit dam with a questionably runnable slot on the left. Rockfish River Road parallels the river closely for about half of this stretch; although it is the least remote part, it is still quite pretty. Rapids are small, a few little ledges. Do not forget that there is a 30 foot or so dam in Schuyler, so take out along Rt 617 before the dam. There does not appear to be a good portage route.</p>
<p><strong>Schuyler to James:</strong> This is an attractive stretch of river that goes around a very long bend with attractive bluffs on the left. There are no hazards or large rapids, although there are one or two class two drops at medium water levels. This trip takes approximately 5 or 6 hours if traveling at a leisurely pace; the velocity is fairly low. This stretch of river can be run whenever the gauge on the Tye is at 110 to 120 cfs, or when the Rockfish is at 85 to 90 cfs. There is plenty of good camping.</p>

<p>The Rush River drains Big Devils Stairs, Little Devils Stairs, North Marshall Mountain, and The Peak in Shenandoah National Park.&nbsp; After passing by the tiny enclave of Washington, it descends rapidly to the Covington and Thornton Rivers.&nbsp; The Rush, along with the Covington, Thornton, Hazel, and Hughes Rivers, is one of the most scenic watersheds in the Piedmont, with spectacular views of mountains and farms.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Trips:</strong></p>
<p>Hunters Road/Route 621 to Rock Mills: One could put in higher up, either on Route 626 just downstream of Route 211, or on Old Route 211, just upstream of the four lane Route 211, but the section from Hunters Road to Rock Mills runs more frequently and is wide enough that strainers should be infrequent.&nbsp; This trip only takes an hour or so with adequate water.</p>

<p><strong>Hunters Road/Route 621:</strong> Park on the narrow shoulder and put in along a small tributary on the downstream side of the road.<br />Rock Mills: Park along the road on the south side of the Thornton River, not on the grassy area that is posted on the north side of the road.&nbsp; Be aware that the large gravel bar sometimes washes over, so do not park there.</p>
<p><strong>Sections of the River to Run:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hunters Road/Route 621 to Rock Mills:</strong> There are no rapids higher than a low class 2 on this run, which has excellent scenery and fast moving water.&nbsp; The gradient is not quite as steep as the parallel section of the Covington, and the drops aren’t quite as high.&nbsp; Be watchful for strainers, as there are a couple blind turns on this stretch that should be scouted.&nbsp; Also, be aware that the bridge at the takeout may have water come up near it in very heavy rains, and cannot be seen through the sycamores growing on the gravel bar just upstream of it, so I recommend taking out on the gravel bar upstream of the bridge, at least to scout the confluence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 50:</strong> On west side of the river, turn north onto Rt 622, which curves around to a public boat landing directly underneath the Rt 50 bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 7:</strong> Turn south on Rt 606 on east side of river and take the first right onto an unmarked gravel road to the public boat landing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 9:</strong> Turn south onto County Road 9/8 on the east bank of the river; the public takeout is directly under the Rt 9 bridge along CR 9/8.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Milville:</strong> There are multiple spots to put in along County Road 27 near Milville.&nbsp; CR 27 runs between Rt 9 and Rt 340.&nbsp; The public boat landing is just below the dam; to avoid a long, flat, stretch with ugly houses on river right, put in farther down along CR 27.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Morgans Ford to Rt 50:</strong> This is a very scenic section of river with good views of the Blue Ridge and plenty of good camping, the archetypal Virginia river.&nbsp; The current’s velocity is moderate.&nbsp; There are only a few good fishing holes.&nbsp; Rapids are negligible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 50 to Rt 7:</strong> Clarke County’s outstanding land use policies have protected this section of river, resulting in a beautiful trip with unspoiled riparian buffers and gorgeous mountain views.&nbsp; There are a few more fishing holes in this stretch than just upstream.&nbsp; There are plenty of campsites.&nbsp; Each fall the Clarke County Watermelon Festival, which has bluegrass, takes place on the riverbank near Lockes Landing, about 2/3 of the way through this trip.&nbsp; There are no significant rapids.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 7 to Rt 9:</strong> This 15 mile stretch is similar to upstream sections except that there are some ugly riverside houses near Rt 9, and very limited camping in the last half to third of the trip.&nbsp; Although still quite pretty, this is the least attractive third of the stretch from Morgans Ford to Rt 9.&nbsp; There are no significant rapids.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 9 to Milville:</strong> I would not recommend running this stretch because it necessitates portaging a dam.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Milville to Potomac:</strong> This is a spectacular day trip that includes running Bull Falls, a class 2 to 3 rapid with several possible lines.&nbsp; Bull Falls marks the end of the flat stretch on which one puts in.&nbsp; Scout Bull Falls from a rock to the right of the falls.&nbsp; The simplest line is center right.&nbsp; Be aware that this hole can easily swamp a canoe at middle to high water levels, with underwater pinning rocks downstream.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would recommend using some floatation if running this stretch at anything but low, late summer levels, in order to avoid the risk of losing a boat.&nbsp; The rapid is not tricky, but you will probably take a lot of water.&nbsp; Below Bull Falls the rapids are smaller all the way to the Potomac, with some pretty ledges downstream of where Rt 340 crosses the Shenandoah.&nbsp; You can take out at the Rt 340 bridge on either side (parking is limited in both cases), or at Brunswick.&nbsp; The Rt 340 bridge below Harpers Ferry is the best day trip takeout.&nbsp; I recommend taking out on river left at Sandy Hook, right under the bridge.&nbsp; Be aware that there is one final rapid before the Rt 340 bridge, a long wave train on river left.&nbsp; The waves can be high enough to put a good deal of water into a canoe at medium water levels.&nbsp; The rapid is fairly straightforward; just keep the boat straight.&nbsp; Enter on river left.&nbsp; This rapid is not visible when you first approach the last line of rocks before Rt 340, so you’ll need to make your way left unless you want to run one of the smaller slots, which is only possible at medium to high water levels.</span></p>

<p>Not too many folks know about this pretty little river that flows through southside and joins the James just west of Bremo Bluff. It is rocky and forested with an old mill along it, needs a little bit of rain to get it flowing.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 617:</strong> Take the Oilville exit off I64 and go north/right on Oilville Rd/Hanover Rd.&nbsp; At the fork in the road bear left onto Oilville/Pinhook Rd.&nbsp; Go north a couple miles and bear right at the next fork, onto Vontay Rd.&nbsp; Then bear left onto Spring Rd, and shortly thereafter you’ll come to the river.&nbsp; This is farther north of I64 than you’d think.&nbsp; Alternatively go south on Bourne Rd from 33, then left on Taylors Creek, then right on Spring Rd.&nbsp; This is an unofficial put in but parking is easy along the road.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Howard Mill:</strong> Go north of Pouncey Tract about a quarter mile west of Pouncey Tract’s intersection with Rt 623/Ashland Rd.&nbsp; Follow Howard Mill for about 5 minutes to the river.&nbsp; This is an unofficial put in.&nbsp; Parking is challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Route 33:</strong> This is an official put in on the south/east side of the river, north side of the road with parking about 15 minutes west of I295.&nbsp; It is easy to go past it as you’re headed west on 33.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 54:</strong> This is a nice put in on the south side of the road, west side of the river, about 15 west of Ashland.&nbsp; There is a Rt 54 exit from 95; head west from there through town and into the country.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Spring Rd Rt 617 to Howard Mill:</strong> This is all flat water.&nbsp; The river is about 20 feet wide with fairly high banks.&nbsp; The water is probably muddy is there is enough to run this section.&nbsp; Dunns Chapel Road crosses the river about 3/5 of the way through the trip.&nbsp; This trip takes several hours if you’re paddling, perhaps all day if you’re not.&nbsp; The gradient is not steep and there are no rapids until the very end, just above Howard Mill. There are numerous tree piles which require portage.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Howard Mill to Rt 33:</strong> The two most exciting rapids on the South Anna are located just above Howard Mill Rd and just above Auburn Mill Rd.&nbsp; This is a fun stretch with steeper gradient but generally easy whitewater interspersed with flat sections.&nbsp; This run only takes an hour and a half or so.&nbsp; I have not run this at very high water levels, at which the two main rapids would probably be pretty difficult.&nbsp; This stretch of river is quite pretty.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 33 to Rt 54:</strong> This run is generally pretty, with a couple of nice rapidy sections above and below Greenwood Church Road (also known as Gilman Bridge), which crosses the South Anna about halfway through the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp; This trip is prettiest at water levels where there is just enough water to float, when all the little islands and grasses and rocks are visible.&nbsp; When the water level gets up near 7 feet the rapids just above and below Greenwood Church get pretty big waves, about as much as an open boat can handle without swamping.&nbsp; Late spring or early summer is a great time for this section.&nbsp; There are a bunch of herons and kingfishers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 54 to Rt 1:</strong> I have only run the part from the confluence of the Newfound to Rt 1, which is completely flat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be careful not to go over the dam just above Rt 1, which is at least 25 feet high and not well marked.&nbsp; You can take out on river right about 20 yards upstream of the dam, where there is a little dirt on the Ashland Mill property that leads to Cross Corner Road, which intersects Rt 1.</span></p>

<p>Many people don’t know that both the South Branch of the Potomac and the North Fork of the South Branch have their origins in Virginia.Both start in the mountains of northern Highland County.The headwaters of the South Branch are located in the westernmost inhabited valley in Highland, near the crossroads of Headwaters on Route 250 and the town of Bluegrass.The South Branch becomes navigable around Bluegrass, as several small tributaries join together from a fan-shaped array of small valleys.Putting in above Blue Grass is possible at very high water levels, as the South Branch runs along Route 642, but inadvisable due to many cattle fences, several low water bridges, and a dam.Below Bluegrass, the South Branch cascades over solid bedrock and some gravel bars to Forks of Water, where it joins Strait Creek and nearly doubles in size.At the confluence with Strait Creek the South Branch makes an abrupt left turn and heads north into West Virginia.</p>
<span face=""Times New Roman"">
<p><strong><span size=""3"">Recommended Trip:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bluegrass to West Virginia:</strong> Put in on the eastern edge of Bluegrass and take out at one of the roadside access points along Route 220 in West Virginia for a pleasant half day or longer trip, depending on how far down Route 220 one wishes to travel.If taking out at the first opportunity in West Virginia, this is about a six mile trip.</p>

<p><span size=""3""><strong>Route 220:</strong> There are a couple roadside take outs along Route 220 approximately one to two miles into West Virginia; pick one, or continue farther downstream.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sections of River to Run:</strong></p>
<p><span size=""3""><strong>Bluegrass to Forks of Water:</strong> From Bluegrass to Forks of Water the South Branch is a medium size stream, not so much a river, that courses over many evenly space bedrock ledges and occasional cobble bars.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most banks are grassy, and strainers are infrequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one boulder garden where Route 642 climbs a hill on river left.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fence across the river just before the South Branch joins Strait Creek at Forks of Water.&nbsp;&nbsp;This run is fairly easy class II.</span></p>
<p><span size=""3""><strong>Forks of Water to West Virginia:</strong> After its confluence with Strait Creek the South Branch relaxes and begins its habit of passing over gravel bars that continues well into West Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;The river continues to be scenic and enjoyable.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Port Republic to Island Ford:</strong> The South Fork is more like a medium sized mountain river south of Massanutten, and flows relatively swiftly over cobble bars.&nbsp; This section of river has extraordinary views of both Massanutten and the Rocky Top/Brown Mountain area of Shenandoah National Park.&nbsp; Full views of the Blue Ridge are visible when the river goes around bends to the east.&nbsp; This 12 mile stretch of river is a good day trip or start of an overnight trip, and has several camping possibilities along the banks.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Island Ford to Elkton:</strong> The South Fork continues to have good views along this 8 mile stretch of river, but is less remote with Route 642 paralleling the right bank for much of the trip.&nbsp; Small riffles and cobble bars are the only rapids.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Elkton to Shenandoah:</strong> Although the paddler must negotiate a couple miles of backwater at the end of this trip, it is a very pretty stretch of river with outstanding views of both Massanutten and the Blue Ridge.&nbsp; At only 7 miles, this is a short day trip.&nbsp; Paddlers passing through Shenandoah should portage the dam on river right, along a marked path.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Shenandoah to Newport:</strong> Due to the dam and power plant near Newport, approximately 15 miles through the trip, canoeists putting in at Shenandoah should consider taking out on river right along Rt 650, shortly downstream of the first Rt 340 bridge.&nbsp; Otherwise it will be necessary to paddle across a couple miles of backwater and then portage on river right to get around the dam.&nbsp; There are no significant rapids on this stretch.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Newport to Honeyville:</strong> This is a short beautiful stretch. One of the most popular day trips, Newport to 211 has a gradient of 8 feet per mile, the highest of any section of this river. One also does not have to worry about any dams.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Honeyville to Rt 211:</strong> This 6 mile trip is a beautiful half day trip.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with dams upstream and downstream of it, it is not recommended as part of a longer trip.&nbsp; There is a large island approximately 1 mile upstream of the Rt 646/Rt 211 takeout.&nbsp; With no adjacent roads, this is a fairly remote stretch of river with only riffles and cobble bars for rapids.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 211 to Rt 675:</strong> This 8 mile stretch of river is not recommended because of the large dam approximately 5 miles into the trip.&nbsp; The dam backs up roughly 2 to 3 miles of slackwater, which is very unpleasant to paddle because of headwinds and unsightly houses on the left bank.&nbsp; The dam does not have a convenient portage, but it can be portaged on river left.&nbsp; The remaining 3 miles or so below the dam are very pretty, with swift moving water, islands, and cobble bars.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 675 to Rt 684:</strong> This beautiful 8 mile trip is an excellent day trip, with attractive riffles and mountain views.&nbsp; Be careful not to miss the Rt 684 take out, a concrete boat ramp on river left.&nbsp; There is a river-wide ledge approximately halfway through the trip that should be run on the left at lower water.&nbsp; Novices should take care not to swamp on this two foot drop.&nbsp; All other rapids are small cobble bars and ledges.</span></p>
<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 684 to Bentonville:</strong> This 21 mile stretch of river is probably the most scenic and exciting on the South Fork.&nbsp; There are ample camping opportunities both at private campgrounds (High Cliff, Hazard Mill) and along un-posted riverbanks.&nbsp; With numerous small ledges as well as Comptons Rapid, this stretch of river moves more quickly and has more rapids than any other on the South Fork.&nbsp; Paddlers will arrive at Comptons Rapid roughly 10 or 11 miles into the trip, at a sharp leftward bend in the river where a high railway trestle is visible on the right.&nbsp; Although not technical, Comptons should be treated with caution because the river is constricted and because canoeists will not be able to see the size of the waves until they are committed to running the rapid.&nbsp; During the spring, waves in Comptons Rapid can easily reach three feet in height and swamp open boats.&nbsp; Canoeists should proceed down the left or right side of the rapid, avoiding the largest waves in the middle and be prepared to take out on either the left or right bank before being swept downstream toward a high cliff.&nbsp; Canoeists who swamp and are not able to take out quickly may have difficulty getting back to shore, as the river widens dramatically and the main current flows against a very high, steep rock cliff downstream.&nbsp; There is a good campsite on river left after Comptons, which can be helpful for folks who swamp and need to dry out their gear.&nbsp; Comptons is by far the largest rapid on this stretch of river.&nbsp; It can be portaged on the right.</span></p>

<p><span face=""Times New Roman""><span size=""3"">Strait Creek joins the South Branch of the Potomac River in Forks of Water, located in northern Highland County, after draining a small, scenic watershed north of Monterey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Strait Creek is small and pebbly, it rarely has enough water to run. However, after a good rain in the spring one can run the few miles from Route 635 or Route 634 to its confluence with the South Branch for a pretty afternoon run.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is located in Highland County, Strait Creek is very pretty and has excellent water quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also has a couple fences across it.</span></span></p>

<p><span size=""3"">Route 635 to Forks of Water: This two mile trip only takes about an hour, but is a nice complement to the nearby South Branch from Blue Grass to West Virginia.&nbsp;If there’s enough water it would be worth an attempt to put in on Route 634 or Route 220 higher upstream.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Fletcher Mill to Rock Mills:</strong> The Thornton has pretty ledges and very low banks from Fletcher Mill to Rock Mills, ensuring a very scenic trip.&nbsp; This section of river is particularly pretty in late April or early May, when wildflowers cover the river banks and newly leafed out trees shade the river.&nbsp; Be aware of possible strainers, due to the fairly narrow river width.&nbsp; The rapids are all small ledges.&nbsp; Route 621, the only bridge that the river goes under during the trip, is high enough that it should not present a hazard.&nbsp; This trip takes about a half day at minimum runnable levels. &nbsp;If the painted gauges on either the Fletcher Mill or Rock Mills bridges read “0” or higher there is enough water for this trip.&nbsp; Generally this section requires significant rain the preceding day to be runnable.&nbsp; There is a USGS gauge on Battle Run, which is a tributary that enters the Thornton east of Laurel Mills.&nbsp; If that gauge reads 200 cubic feet per second or higher, there is probably enough water to run the Thornton from Fletcher Mill to Rock Mills (<a href=""http://water.usgs.gov/waterwatch/"">http://water.usgs.gov/waterwatch/</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rock Mills to Monumental Mills:</strong> Most people take out at Rock Mills and never see the rest of the </span><st1:city><st1:place>Thornton</st1:place></st1:city><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">, which continues to be a beautiful stream all the way to its confluence with the Hazel. The best part of the trip is the four to five mile stretch to Laurel Mills, which has a few class I rock gardens and numerous rock bluffs. If the rain didn’t occur immediately prior to the trip the water may have a beautiful turquoise-green hue. A surprisingly healthy set of hemlock groves cover much of the north-facing river bank. There are only a couple brief unattractive sections where a farmer has pushed concrete debris and stumps onto the river bank to prevent it from eroding; otherwise the scenery is unspoiled. Down toward Monumental Mills the river flattens out and has higher banks, but until the final stretch the current remains strong and there are long stretches of low banks that permit expansive views of the surrounding countryside. This stretch often runs in the spring when bluebells and other wildflowers cover the banks. A reading of 4.75 feet on the Remington gauge could be considered the bare minimum, with a reading of 5 feet sufficient to run this section without scraping at all. This trip is 14 miles, and goes surprisingly quickly with good water velocity, taking roughly 6 hours of floating with intermittent paddling.</span></p>

</span><span class=""blog"" face=""verdana, geneva"" size=""3"">
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(overnighter): Put in at Massies Mill and take out at Wingina on the James.&nbsp; This is a very full two day trip, perhaps the most fun, scenic two day trip on a mid size river in any part of central Virginia, with outstanding views, fun little rapids, and amazing topographic variety.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(day trip) Appalachian Trail (or higher) to Massies Mill.&nbsp; This is a fun class 2+ run when there’s been some rain.&nbsp; Usually there isn’t enough water, so catch it while it is up.&nbsp; If you can’t see too many rocks from the AT bridge over the Tye, there is enough water.&nbsp; Definitely have flotation in your boat and be ready for constant activity.&nbsp; This only takes an hour and a half or so.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">(day trip) Appalachian Trail to Rose Hill Rd (or Gulf Ford).&nbsp; This is a 2/3 of a day trip for higher water levels.&nbsp; If going to Gulf Ford you need high water levels and a full day, but that would be probably the best day trip in the state that I’m aware of.</span></li>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Massies Mill:</strong> There is a little roadside park where you can put in off Rt 56.&nbsp; This and the AT put in are west of the intersection of 56 and Rt 151.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt151/56 intersection:</strong> There is parking/access along the side of 56 just west of 151.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rose Hill Rd:</strong> This is an unofficial takeout just a couple miles west of 29 on Rose Hill Road.&nbsp; Be discreet putting in and taking out, which is a pain with the steep slopes, but this can be a convenient take out/put in depending on which section you want to run.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 29:</strong> You can drive down a grassy hill (fairly steep) from Hwy 20 on the south side of the river, east side of the road, just above the little old dam. &nbsp;Parking here is questionable.&nbsp; If you want to take out near 29 it is better to drive down Tye River Road, which intersects Rt 29 just north of the river, to a little takeout near the Tye River Road bridge over the Tye.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Gulf Ford Road:</strong> From Tye River Rd take Gulf Ford Rd (perhaps also called Falling Rock Rd) north until you reach the 1 lane bridge.&nbsp; There is a little unofficial, though unposted, take out to the west of the road on the south bank of the river.&nbsp;&nbsp; Park on the roadside.&nbsp; I’ve never seen a car ticketed here, just make sure you’re not poking out in the road.&nbsp; Note that the road down to this bridge is very narrow and fairly steep, not a good place to drive in snowy or icy conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Wingina:</strong> Where Rt 56 crosses the James, about 3 miles downstream of the Tye/James confluence.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Sections of River to Run:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Appalachian Trail to Massies Mill:</strong> This is very fast, very rocky, very narrow, almost constant class 2+ whitewater.&nbsp; Make sure you have some experience before canoeing this, and have a throw bag with you.&nbsp; Definitely have flotation in your boat.&nbsp; Check carefully for strainers, ie don’t run blind turns; the river is narrow enough that a fallen tree could create a dangerous strainer, although I’ve never encountered one.&nbsp; This is a great deal of fun, and runnable in a canoe where the forks of the Tye probably aren’t.&nbsp; Bring a bailer and be prepared to eddy out frequently to dump out the water.&nbsp; The views are great if you get a second to check them out, particularly looking back at the Priest and Three Ridges.&nbsp; There are also nice old farmhouses.&nbsp; This stretch only takes an hour or so.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Massies Mill to 151/56 intersection:</strong> This is class 1 whitewater, mainly ledges and gravel bars, with unbelievable views of the Blue Ridge.&nbsp; This run takes just an hour or so.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rt 151/56 to Rose Hill:</strong> More beautiful views and fun little rapids, nice farmland, probably about 3 hours to run.&nbsp; You’ll go under the Rt 56 bridge about halfway through this one.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Rose Hill Road to Tye River Road:</strong> Another outstanding section of river with frequent small rapids, including the lovely confluence with the Piney River.&nbsp; Thanks to those invovled in removing the old dam from this section.&nbsp; After the old dam site you’ll go through some fun little rapids with cliffs to your right before going under a high railroad trestle, then under Tye River Road.&nbsp; The takeout is a little sandy patch on your left.&nbsp; This stretch would take about a half day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Tye River Road to Gulf Ford:</strong> This is the prettiest stretch after the upper part, cutting through an extraordinary gorge near Gulf Ford.&nbsp; The rapids are a little bigger than on the stretch from Massies Mill to Tye River Road.&nbsp; This takes a couple hours.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Gulf Ford to Wingina:</strong> This is about a half day trip with some small rapids.&nbsp; The Tye flattens out quite a bit after leaving the gorge near Gulf Ford.</span></p>",,1,1,0,43,"2011-03-12 20:04:23",62,,"2012-01-07 18:10:03",63,0,"0000-00-00 00:00:00","2011-03-12 20:04:23","0000-00-00 00:00:00",,,"show_title=

There is a nice information board and walking trail at Rt 603/Park Road.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">The Willis is more like a linear pool than a river, one that has been partially filled with dead trees. While there are some very attractive areas of rock outcrops and riverside beech groves, the frequent strainers make this a less attractive river compared to others nearby like the Slate, James, and Appomattox. &nbsp;However, if you want to ensure that you are canoeing in a place that you will see nobody else, the Willis is guaranteed to offer that solitude. &nbsp;It also has the usual Southside accompaniment of wildlife, though fauna is likely to be scared off by the sound of a canoe and human thrashing over, under, and through trees that inexplicably populate what in most drainages would be a free flowing river. &nbsp;Roger Corbett has suggested that stretches upstream of Trenton Mills are navigable but I would not suggest trying it.</span></p>

<p class=""blog""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Down to Mount Jackson:</strong> In the upper section, Mill Creek is a tiny stream that courses over countless small ledges. &nbsp;It offers the best of the Valley. &nbsp;By and by you will come to a long rock slide. &nbsp;If you thought water levels were minimal before they will seem really minimal here, and it may be impossible to float through in a tandem canoe (photo below). &nbsp;After navigating this ledge be on the lookout for a big ledge down below. &nbsp;There is a dangerous rapid where, at low water levels, almost all the water goes through a sieve on the left. &nbsp;Portage down the rock ledge on the right. &nbsp;If you have enough water to run the ledge shown below without scraping you may also have enough water to run down the right side of the big ledge, in which case you will be dropping some 7-8 feet nearly vertically into a rather small, not particularly deep pool. &nbsp;The main hazard are some potential pinning rocks shortly downstream, which would appear to be prone to catch strainers. &nbsp;Below this ledge (which is easily safely portaged at lower runnable levels), you will enter a hundred yard long class 2 rapid with significant ledges and holes. &nbsp;Be prepared to get pushed left into a diagonal hole that you will want to enter with a good brace, leaning hard left/downstream. The hole is surprisingly strong. &nbsp;Not to far below this slalom is an old dam that is a pain to portage, and shortly after the dam you will enter Mount Jackson. &nbsp;This stream may sound like a lot of work from the description, but it is worth it for enjoyable ledges, attractive scenery, and unusual rock formations.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" face=""Calibri, serif"">Few streams have as storied a history as Bull Run, site of two major battles in the Civil War, including First Bull Run/First Manassas, which marked the beginning of a very long war. Even in Virginia, with its countless Civil War battlefield and skirmish sites, Bull Run stands out, and one feels that graveside flowers would be more appropriate to bring canoeing than a cooler of beer. Today, far more profane than any quantity of alcohol, sprawl surrounds the battlefield, I-66's unceasing noise prevents reflection, and the waters have become more turbid with concrete channeled runoff. Despite being so defiled, Bull Run courses through a relatively undisturbed riparian corridor before entering the Occoquan Reservoir and merging with Broad Run. Between the area north of the battlefield and the sprawl of Manassas, it passes through lovely open space preserved permanently by Franklin Roosevelt as Manassas Battlefield Park, a unit of the National Park system. It is a reminder of what the rest of Northern Virginia once looked at: clear water (clearer, at least), attractive bluffs with north facing hemlocks, bluebells in April, and open floodplains. While there are less disturbed rivers elsewhere in the Commonwealth, Bull Run is a worthy paddle for Northern Virginians and those who wish to pay their respects to the soldiers who perished as a result of secession.</span></p>

Paddlers will find a seductive little stream with clear green water flowing over a generally bedrock substrate, with a riparian corridor populated by a remarkable array of wildlife. The fecundity of the Valley is on full display along the Opequon, made visible by minks, herons, great schools of fish and armadas of kingfishers. Clark County graces the creek's right bank, and her banks seem to bow low so that paddlers may observe what a rural county should look like--agricultural, no vinyl, with handsome farms and large sycamores along the river.</span></p>

Continue north one mile and turn left, downhill, on a small gravel road that terminates at the creek. There is only parking for a car. This used to be a ford but is no longer accessible from the west. Finally, not that Rt 645 is not called ""Affleck Rd"" as the Gazetteer suggests, nor is Rt 635 a through road, necessitating a slightly longer shuttle using Rt 632.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" face=""Calibri, serif""><strong>Route 723 to Burnt Factory:</strong> This pleasant half to full day trip follows the Opequon from its youth to maturity. From a very small creek it adds water consistently, and is a small river by the time it flows under Rt 7. If the streamside gauge at Rt 7 has 1.9 feet there is sufficient water, perhaps equal to 75 cfs. A bedrock substrate means much of the stream is passable even a while after a rain. This stream is probably navigable within a week of a wet spell or more shortly after isolated heavy rain. It is a class 1 paddle, with small ledges and the possibility of an occasional strainer. Except for occasional bank erosion the scenery is attractive, with alternating pastures and evergreen covered rocky hillside banks. The water is clear green, permitting views of many fish, though not too many appear very large. There are two road bridges and one low water bridge serving a municipal facility between Rt 723 and Route 7. After passing under Rt 7, it is only a mile to the take out, which one should take care not to float past since it doesn't have a bridge. The only unpleasant feature of this trip is the Winchester sewer treatment outflow at Rt 7. This trip is approximately 9 miles and takes paddling to navigate many tight turns and, depending on water level, little chutes and shallow areas.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"" size=""3"">Overview:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;"">Shaws Fork and its headwaters run off the western flank of Shenandoah Mountain in Highland County. It joins the Cowpasture River at the crossroads of Liberty. Though the stream keeps the name Cowpasture, Shaws Fork is a larger tributary upstream of Liberty. In its short life Shaws Fork crosses through some attractive farmland and forests, cascading over a bedrock substrate that forms complex ledges with attractive small cliffs along the way. Though inconvenienced by several cattle fences and an occasional strainer, this stream is well worth a run for scenery and enjoyable rapids. As with all streams on private land in Bath and Highland counties, be aware that public riparian rights are less secure than in most of the rest of the state, so take extreme care not to irritate landowners, and ask permission if in doubt. If taken to court for trespassing (by paddling) on streams such as Shaws Fork, one may well lose.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Headwaters to Liberty:</strong> Shaws Fork is approximately 10 feet wide at the start of this trip. Several landowners have taken advantage of the stream’s wide by placing complex fences across it, as well as a single strand of barbed wire further south, which leaps out of the water periodically due to the current when Shaws Fork has sufficient water. Beyond these dangers (and a couple downed trees), Shaws Fork is very enjoyable, with attractive farms, cliffs, and rapids. The stream’s solid rock bottom creates interesting sloping drops and ledges. The current moves very quickly for the duration of the trip to Liberty. The hardest rapid is a class 2 ledge series that ends with a serrated rock ridge running parallel to the current down the final sloping drop. There are plenty of good surfing holes where these sloping rocks end. The Cowpasture gauge needs to be well over 1,000 cfs for Shaws Fork to run.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" size=""3"">Overview:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,geneva;"" face=""Times New Roman, serif""><span size=""3"">Overview: Much of northwestern Loudoun County is in the attractive Catoctin Creek watershed. Catoctin Creek and her tributaries flow north from the Hillsboro, Wheatland, Waterford, and Morrisonville areas before joining the Potomac River about a mile upstream of Point of Rocks. This stream has enough water to float down fairly frequently, particularly below Featherbed Road, and does not have any significant rapids or hazards. If there has been significant rain in the last 24 hours Catoctin Creek is very likely to have enough water to be runnable, and it probably will be passable in winter and early spring unless there has been a dry spell.</span></span></p>
